The schema from $master_schema differs from
the running database. As a safety measure, you will not be able to install
until this is resolved.

If you are a user of the emulab software outside of Utah, this is probably
because your database was created for an older version of the emulab software.
Contact testbed-ops\@eMulab.net for help in updating your database.

If you're a developer at Utah, this is probably because you (or someone else)
forgot to update sql/database-create.sql .
