# Strategy for picking the right priority entry for a user/group/job
# triple. The strategy is a permutation of "cgu", "c"ommand, "g"roup,
# "u"ser. The order specifies the affinity of the priority lookup
# method. "cug" means an exact match of the command has priority
# over an exact match of the user or group. See the documentation
# for more details.
#
affinity cpug

#
# Minimum user/group id to be even considered for renicing. Processes
# with lower user/group id are ignored. This does not affect root
# (user id 0), which is never, ever reniced.
