<p>Emulab is a universally available
time- and space-shared network emulator which achieves new levels of
ease of use. Several hundred PCs in racks, combined with secure,
user-friendly web-based tools, and driven by <i>ns</i>-compatible
scripts or a Java GUI, allow you to remotely configure and control
machines and links down to the hardware level.  Packet loss, latency,
bandwidth, queue sizes-all can be user-defined.  Even the OS disk
contents can be fully and securely replaced with custom images by any
experimenter; Emulab can load ten or a hundred disks in less than two
minutes. 
Emulab strives to preserve the control and ease of use of
simulation, without sacrificing the realism of emulation and live
network experimentation.
