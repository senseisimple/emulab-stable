<h1>Do It Yourself Routing Tutorial</h1>
</center>

If you <em>really</em> want to setup and manage routing entirely by
yourself, you can use the <tt>tb-set-node-startup</tt> command in your
NS file to specify a per-node script in your home directory to set up
routing at boot time. You can use this startup script to setup either
static routes or to fire up a routing daemon. We do not recommend this
approach anymore, but it is there if you need more control over your
routing than we provide. The following examples illustrate this
approach. 

<p>
The simplest topology requiring routing is one in which two nodes,
<i>client</i> and <i>server</i> are each connected via a single link
to <i>router</i>.  In order to get router to correctly forward packets
between client and server, you would add this line to your NS file:

<code><pre>
tb-set-node-startup $router /proj/pid/router-startup
</pre></code>

This will make router run the <code>router-startup</code> script
from you project directory.  That script looks like:

<code><pre>
#!/bin/sh
if [ `uname` = "FreeBSD" ]
then
    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.fastforwarding=1
else
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
fi
exit 0
</pre></code>

These commands ensure that the router node will forward IP packets.
Note the use of <code>sudo</code> which is necessary since startup scripts
run as you and not as root.

Now to get client and server to talk to each other through this router,
you would add these lines to your NS file:

<code><pre>
tb-set-node-startup $client /proj/pid/clientroutecmd
tb-set-node-startup $server /proj/pid/serverroutecmd
</pre></code>

This will have the client and the server each call a small script
to set up routes. To add a route (on client) to interface 0 of the
server through router, you would run a script called
<code>clientroutecmd</code> that looks like this:

<code><pre>
#!/bin/sh
if [ `uname` = "FreeBSD" ]
then
    sudo route add server-0 router
else
    sudo route add server-0 gw router
fi
exit 0
</pre></code>

Similarly, to add a route (on server) to interface 0 of the client
through router, you would use this <code>serverroutecmd</code> script:

<code><pre>
#!/bin/sh
if [ `uname` = "FreeBSD" ]
then
    sudo route add client-0 router
else
    sudo route add client-0 gw router
fi
exit 0
</pre></code>

That should do it. You will now have a router node that really
routes and forwards packets, and a client and a server that know
how to talk to each other through a gateway router.
Note that this setup can be generalized to work for any topology
where all nodes are directly connected to a single router node.
However, every node would need a custom script with a route add command
for every other node or you would need to use a subnet route as in
the next example.

<p>
In complex topologies with multiple routers, each end node will need
a route to the entire experimental network, through its local router.
For FreeBSD, this is done with:

<code><pre>
#!/bin/sh
if [ `uname` = "FreeBSD" ]
then
    sudo route add -net 192.168.0.0 -netmask 255.255.0.0 myrouter
else
    sudo route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw myrouter
fi
exit 0
</pre></code>

You might be tempted to just set the default route for each node to
<code>myrouter</code>, but be aware that such a route would prevent
you from contacting the outside world.  The default route <em>must</em>
be set to use the control network interface.

<p>
You can make a single script that will handle all end nodes, by replacing
<code>myrouter</code> in the above commands with <code>$1</code>,
and specifying the router in your NS file:

<code><pre>
tb-set-node-startup $clientA {/proj/pid/router-startup router0}
tb-set-node-startup $clientB {/proj/pid/router-startup router1}
</pre></code>

For multiple routers, the startup script for each router will need to
contain a set of routes for all subnets it is not directly connected
to. This will differ, depending on the topology you are using. To make
this task easier, you can use the <code>tb-set-ip</code> command in your NS
file, so that you know which subnets will be assigned to which nodes.

<p>
If you want to enable dynamic routing,
you can also use the startup script to fire off a routing daemon.
A startup script might look like:

<code><pre>
#!/bin/sh
if [ `uname` = "FreeBSD" ]
then
    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.fastforwarding=1
else
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
fi
sudo gated -f /proj/pid/gated.conf
exit 0
</pre></code>

One complication of using a routing daemon, is that you need to
avoid using the control network interface in the configuration.
Since every node in the testbed is directly connected to the
control network LAN, a naive routing daemon configuration will
discover that any node is just one hop away via the control
network and <em>all</em> inter-node traffic will be routed via
that interface.  
See one of the installed <tt>/etc/testbed/gated*.conf</tt>
files for an example of how to avoid this pitfall.
