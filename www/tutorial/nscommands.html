<a name="INTRO"></a><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In order to use the testbed specific commands you must include the
following line near the top of your NS file (before any testbed
commands are used):

<pre>
source tb_compat.tcl
</pre>

<p>If you wish to use your file under NS you can use download this <a
href=http://www.emulab.net/tutorial/tb_compat.tcl>tb_compat.tcl</a>.
Place it in the same directory as your NS file.  When run in this way
under NS the testbed commands will have no effect, but NS will be able
to parse your file.

<hr>

<a name="TCL"></a><h3>TCL, NS, and node names</h3>

In your file you will be creating nodes with something like:

<pre>
set node1 [$ns node]
</pre>

What is really going on is that the simulator, represented by
<code>$ns</code> is creating a new node, involving a bunch of internal
data changes, and returning a reference to it which is stored in the
variable <code>node1</code>.  In almost all cases, when you need to
refer to a node you will do it as <code>$node1</code>, the
<code>$</code> indicating that you want the value of the variable
<code>node1</code>, i.e. the reference to the node.  Thus you will be
issuing commands like:

<pre>
$ns duplex-link $node1 $node2 100Mb 150ms DropTail
tb-set-ip $node1 10.1.0.2
</pre>

<p>(Note the <code>$</code>'s)

<p>You will notice that when your experiment is setup the node names
and such will be <code>node1</code>.  This happens because the parser
detects what variable you are using to store the node reference and
uses that as the node name.  In the case that you do something like:

<pre>
set node1 [$ns node2]
set A $node1
</pre>

<p>The node will still be called <code>node1</code> as that was the first
variable to contain the reference.

<p>If you are dealing with many nodes you may store them in array,
perhaps like this:

<pre>
for {set i 0} {$i < 4} {incr i} {
   set nodes($i) [$ns node]
}
</pre>

<p>In this case the names of the node will be <code>nodes-0</code>,
<code>nodes-1</code>, <code>nodes-2</code>, <code>nodes-3</code>. (In
other words, the <code>(</code> character is replaced with
<code>-</code>, and <code>)</code> is removed.)  This slightly
different syntax is used to avoid any problems that <code>()</code>
may cause later in the process. For example, the <code>()</code>
characters cannot appear in DNS entries.

<p>As a final note, everything said above for nodes applies equally to
lans.  I.e.:

<pre>
set lan0 [$ns make-lan "$node0 $node1" 100Mb 0ms]
tb-set-lan-loss $lan0 .02
</pre>

<p>(Again, note the <code>$</code>'s)

<p>Links can also be named just like nodes and lans.  The names can
then be used to set loss rates or IP addresses.  This technique is the
only way to set such attributes when there are multiple links between
two nodes.

<pre>
set link1 [$ns duplex-link $node0 $node1 100Mb 0ms DropTail]
tb-set-link-loss $link1 0.05
tb-set-ip-link $node0 $link1 10.1.0.128
</pre>

<hr>

<a name="PARAMETERS"></a><h3>Captured NS file parameters</h3>

<p>A common convention when writing NS files is to place any parameters in an
array named "opt" at the beginning of the file.  For example:

<code><pre>
    set opt(CLIENT_COUNT) 5
    set opt(BW) 10mb;    Link bandwidth
    set opt(LAT) 10ms;   Link latency

   ...

    $ns duplex-link $server $router $opt(BW) $opt(LAT) DropTail

    for {set i 0} {$i < $opt(CLIENT_COUNT)} {incr i} {
        set nodes($i) [$ns node]
	...
    }

    set serverprog [$server program-agent -command "starter.sh"]
</pre></code>

Normally, this convention is only used to help organize the parameters.  In
Emulab, however, the contents of the "opt" array are captured and made
available to the emulated environment.  For instance, the parameters are added
as environment variables to any commands run by <a
href="docwrapper.php3?docname=eventsystem.html#PROGRAM">program-agents</a>
(only available on recent FBSD410-STD and RHL90-STD images).  So, in the above
example of NS code, the "starter.sh" script will be able to reference
parameters by name, like so:

<code><pre>
    #! /bin/sh

    echo "Testing with $CLIENT_COUNT clients."
    ...
</pre></code>

Note that the contents of the "opt" array are not ordered, so you should not
reference other parameters and expect the shell to expand them appropriately:

<code><pre>
    set opt(prefix) "/foo/bar"
    set opt(BINDIR) '$prefix/bin'; # BAD

    set opt(prefix) "/foo/bar"
    set opt(BINDIR) "$opt(prefix)/bin"; # Good
</pre></code>

<hr>

<a name="ORDER"></a><h3>Ordering Issues</h3>

<p>tb- commands have the same status as all other Tcl and NS commands.
Thus the order matters not only relative to each other but also
relative to other commands.  One common example of this is that IP
commands must be issued after the links or lans are created.

<hr>

<a name="HARD"></a><h3>Hardware Commands</h3>

<a name="tb-set-hardware"></a><h4>tb-set-hardware</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-hardware <i>node</i> <i>type</i> [<i>args</i>].

tb-set-hardware $node3 pc
tb-set-hardware $node4 shark
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The name of the node.
  <dt><i>type</i> - The type of the node.
</dl>

<p>Notes:

<ul>
  <li> Please see the <a href=https://www.emulab.net/nodecontrol_list.php3>
       Node Status</a> page for a list of available types.
       <code>pc</code> is the default type. 
  <li> No current types have any additional arguments.
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="IP"></a><h3>IP Address Commands</h3>

<p>Each node will be assigned an IP address for each interface that is
in use.  The following commands will allow you to explicitly set those
IP addresses.  IP addresses will be automatically generated for all
nodes that you do not explicitly set IP addresses.

<p>In the common case the IP addresses on either side of a link must
be in the same subnet.  Likewise, all IP addresses on a LAN should be
in the same subnet. Generally the same subnet should not be used for
more than one link or LAN in a given experiment, nor should one node
have multiple interfaces in the same subnet. Automatically generated
IP addresses will conform to these requirements.  If part of a link or
lan is explicitly specified with the commands below then the remainder
will be automatically generated under the same subnet.

<p>IP address assignment is deterministic and tries to fill lower IP's
first, starting at 2.  Except in the partial specification case (see
above), all automatic IP addresses are in the network
<code>10</code>.

<a name="tb-set-ip"></a><h4>tb-set-ip</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-ip <i>node</i> <i>ip</i>

tb-set-ip $node1 142.3.4.5
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The node to assign the IP address to.
  <dt><i>ip</i> - The IP address.
</dl>

<p>Notes:

<ul>
  <li>This command should only be used for nodes that have a single
      link.  For nodes with multiple links the following commands should be
      used.  Mixing <code>tb-set-ip</code> and any other IP command on
      the same node will result in an error.
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-ip-link"></a><h4>tb-set-ip-link</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-ip-link <i>node</i> <i>link</i> <i>ip</i>

tb-set-ip-link $node0 $link0 142.3.4.6
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The node to set the IP for.
  <dt><i>link</i> - The link to set the IP for.
  <dt><i>ip</i> - The IP address.
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>One way to think of the arguments is a link with the node
      specifying which side of the link to set the IP for.
  <li>This command can not be mixed with <code>tb-set-ip</code> on the
      same node.
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-ip-lan"></a><h4>tb-set-ip-lan</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-ip-lan <i>node</i> <i>lan</i> <i>ip</i>

tb-set-ip-lan $node1 $lan0 142.3.4.6
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The node to set the IP for.
  <dt><i>lan</i> - The lan the IP is on.
  <dt><i>ip</i> - The IP address.
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>One way to think of the arguments is a node with the LAN
      specifying which port to set the IP address for.
  <li>This command can not be mixed with <code>tb-set-ip</code> on the
same node.
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-ip-interface"></a><h4>tb-set-ip-interface</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-ip-interface <i>node</i> <i>dst</i> <i>ip</i>

tb-set-ip-interface $node2 $node1 142.3.4.6
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The node to set the IP for.
  <dt><i>dst</i> - The destination of the link to set the IP for.
  <dt><i>IP</i> - The IP address.
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command can not be mixed on the same node with
      <code>tb-set-ip</code>.  (See above)
  <li>In the case of multiple links between the same pair of nodes
      there is no way to distinguish which link to the set the IP
      for.  This should be fixed soon.
  <li>This command is converted internally to either tb-set-ip-link or
      tb-set-ip-lan.  It is possible that error messages will report
      either of those commands instead of tb-set-ip-interface.
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-netmask"></a><h4>tb-set-netmask</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-netmask <i>lanlink</i> <i>netmask</i>

tb-set-netmask $link0 "255.255.255.248"
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>lanlink</i> - The lan or link to set the netmask for.
  <dt><i>netmask</i> - The netmask in dotted notation.
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command sets the netmask for a lan or link. The mask must
      be big enough to support all of the nodes on the lan or link!
  <li>You may play with the bottom three octets (0xFFFFFXXX) of the
      mask; attempts to change the upper octets will cause an error.
</ul>


<hr>

<a name="OS"></a><h3>OS Commands</h3>

<a name="tb-set-node-os"></a><h4>tb-set-node-os</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-node-os <i>node</i> <i>os</i>

tb-set-node-os $node1 FBSD-STD
tb-set-node-os $node1 MY_OS
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The node to set the OS for.
  <dt><i>os</i> - The id of the OS for that node.
</dl>

<p>Notes:

<ul>
  <li>The OSID can either by one of the standard OS's we provide or
      a custom OSID, created via the web interface.
  <li>If no OS is specified for a node a default OS is chosen based on
      the nodes type.  This is currently RHL-STD for PCs.
  <li>The currently available standard OS types are: FBSD-STD, RHL-STD, 
      <a href="../doc/docwrapper.php3?docname=windows.html">WINXP-UPDATE</a>, 
      NBSD14-STD (should not be used on PC nodes), and
      NETBOOT-STD (oskit netboot kernel for loading other
      operating systems over the network). <p>

      <a href="../kb-show.php3?xref_tag=SWS-WIN2K">Windows 2000</a> is not supported. <p>

      Click <a href="https://www.emulab.net/showosid_list.php3">List ImageIDs and
      OSIDs</a> in the Emulab web interface "Interaction" pane to see the
      current list of Emulab-supplied OSs.
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-node-rpms"></a><h4>tb-set-node-rpms</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-node-rpms <i>node</i> <i>rpms...</i>

tb-set-node-rpms $node0 rpm1 rpm2 rpm3
</pre>

<p>Notes:

<ul>
  <li>This command sets which rpms are to be installed on the node
  when it first boots after being assigned to an experiment.
  <li>Each rpm can be either a path to a file or a URL. Paths must be to files
  that reside in /proj or /groups. You are not allowed to place your rpms in
  your home directory. <code>http(s)://</code> and <code>ftp://</code> URLs will
  be fetched into the experiment's directory, and re-distributed from there.
  <li>See the <a href="docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#RPMS">
  tutorial</a> for more information.
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-node-startcmd"></a><h4>tb-set-node-startcmd</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-node-startcmd <i>node</i> <i>startupcmd</i>

tb-set-node-startcmd $node0 "mystart.sh -a >& /tmp/node0.log"
</pre>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>Specify a script or program to be run when the node is booted.
  <li>See the
  <a href="docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#Startupcmd">
  tutorial</a> for more information.
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-node-cmdline"></a><h4>tb-set-node-cmdline</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-node-cmdline <i>node</i> <i>cmdline</i>

tb-set-node-cmdline $node0 {???}
</pre>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>Set the command line, to be passed to the <i>kernel</i> when it
  is booted.
  <li>Currently, this is supported on OSKit kernels only. 
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-node-tarfiles"></a><h4>tb-set-node-tarfiles</h4>

<pre>tb-set-node-tarfiles <i>node</i> <i>install-dir1</i> <i>tarfile1</i> ...</pre>

The <tt>tb-set-node-tarfiles</tt> command is used to install one or more tar
files onto a node's local disk.  This command is useful for installing files
that are used frequently, but will change very little during the course of your
experiments.  For example, if your software depends on a third-party library
not provided in the standard disk images, you can produce a tarball and have
the library ready for use on all the experimental nodes.  Another example would
be the data sets for your software.  The benefit of installing files using this
method is that they will reside on the node's local disk, so your experimental
runs will not be disrupted by NFS traffic.  Finally, you will want to avoid
using this command if the files are changing frequently because the tars are
only (re)installed when the nodes boot.

<p>
Installing individual tar files or RPMs is a midpoint in the spectrum of
getting software onto the experimental nodes.  At one extreme, you can read
everything over NFS, which works well if the files are changing constantly, but
can generate a great deal of strain on the control network and disrupt your
experiment.  The tar files and RPMs are also read over NFS when the nodes
initially boot, however, there won't be any extra NFS traffic while you are
running your experiment.  Finally, if you need a lot of software installed on a
large number of nodes, say greater than 20, it might be best to create a <a
href="docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#CustomOS">custom disk image</a>.
Using a disk image is easier on the control network since it is transferred
using multicast, thus greatly reducing the amount of NFS traffic when the
experiment is swapped in.

<br><br>

<i>Required Parameters:</i>

<ul>
  <li><i>node</i> - The node where the files should be installed.  Each node
  has its own tar file list, which may or may not be different from the
  others.
  <li>One or more <i>install-dir</i> and <i>tarfile</i> pairs are then listed
  in the order you wish them to be installed:
  <ul>
    <li><i>install-dir</i> - An existing directory on the node where the tar
    file should be unarchived (e.g. '/', '/usr', '/usr/local').  The "tar"
    command will be run as "root"<a href="#tb-set-node-tarfilesNOTE1">[1]</a>,
    so all of the node's directories will be accessible to you.  If the
    directory does not exist on the image or was not created by the unarchiving
    of a previous tar file, the installation will fail<a
    href="#tb-set-node-tarfilesNOTE2">[2]</a>.

    <li><i>tarfile</i> - An existing tar file located in a project directory
    (e.g. '/proj' or '/groups') or an http, https, or ftp URL.  In the case of
    URLs, they are downloaded when the experiment is swapped in and cached in
    the experiment's directory for future use.  In either case, the tar file
    name is <i>required</i> to have one of the following extensions: .tar,
    .tar.Z, .tar.gz, or .tgz.  Note that the tar file could have been created
    anywhere, however, if you want the unarchived files to have valid Emulab
    user and group id's, you should create the tar file on ops or an
    experimental node.
  </ul>
</ul>

<i>Example usage:</i>

</ul>

<i>Notes:</i>

<ol>
<a name="tb-set-node-tarfilesNOTE1"></a><li>Because the files are installed as
root, care must be taken to protect the tar file so it cannot be replaced with
a trojan that allowed less privileged users to become root.

<a name="tb-set-node-tarfilesNOTE2"></a><li>Currently, you can only tell
how/why an installation failed by examining the node's console log on bootup.
</ol>

<hr>

<a name="LOSS"></a><h3>Link Loss Commands</h3>

<p>This is the NS syntax for creating a link:

<pre>
$ns duplex-link $node1 $node2 100Mb 150ms DropTail
</pre>

<p>Note that it does not allow for specifying link loss rates.  Emulab
does, however, support link loss.  The following commands can be used
to specify link loss rates.

<a name="tb-set-link-loss"></a><h4>tb-set-link-loss</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-link-loss <i>src</i> <i>dst</i> <i>loss</i>
tb-set-link-loss <i>link</i> <i>loss</i>

tb-set-link-loss $node1 $node2 0.05
tb-set-link-loss $link1 0.02
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>src</i>, <i>dst</i> - Two nodes to describe the link.
  <dt><i>link</i> - The link to set the rate for.
  <dt><i>loss</i> - The loss rate (between 0 and 1).
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>There are two syntax's available.  The first specifies a link by
      a source/destination pair.  The second explicitly specifies the
      link.
  <li>The source/destination pair is incapable of describing an
      individual link in the case of multiple links between two
      nodes.  Use the second syntax for this case.
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-lan-loss"></a><h4>tb-set-lan-loss</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-lan-loss <i>lan</i> <i>loss</i>

tb-set-lan-loss $lan1 0.3
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>lan</i> - The lan to set the loss rate for.
  <dt><i>loss</i> - The loss rate (between 0 and 1).
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command sets the loss rate for the entire LAN.
</ul>

<a name="tb-set-node-lan-delay"></a><h4>tb-set-node-lan-delay</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-node-lan-delay <i>node</i> <i>lan</i> <i>delay</i>

tb-set-node-lan-delay $node0 $lan0 40ms
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The node we are modifying the delay for.
  <dt><i>lan</i> - Which LAN the node is in that we are affecting.
  <dt><i>delay</i> - The new node to switch delay (see below).
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command changes the delay between the node and the
      switch of the LAN.  This is only half of the trip a packet must
      take.  The packet will also traverse the switch to the
      destination node, possibly incurring additional latency from any
      delay parameters there.
  <li>If this command is not used to overwrite the delay, then the
      delay for a given node to switch link is taken as one half of
      the delay passed to <code>make-lan</code>.  Thus in a LAN where
      no <code>tb-set-node-delay</code> calls are made the node to
      node latency will be the latency passed to
      <code>make-lan</code>.
  <li>The behavior of this command is not defined when used with nodes
      that are in the same LAN multiple times.
  <li>Delays of less than 2ms (per trip) are too small to be
      accurately modeled at this time, and will be silently ignored.
      As a convenience, a delay of 0ms can be used to indicate that
      you do not want added delay; the two interfaces will be
      "directly" connected to each other.
</ul>

<a name="tb-set-node-lan-bandwidth"></a><h4>tb-set-node-lan-bandwidth</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-node-lan-bandwidth <i>node</i> <i>lan</i> <i>bandwidth</i>

tb-set-node-lan-bandwidth $node0 $lan0 20Mb
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The node we are modifying the bandwidth for.
  <dt><i>lan</i> - Which LAN the node is in that we are affecting.
  <dt><i>bandwidth</i> - The new node to switch bandwidth (see below).
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command changes the bandwidth between the node and the
      switch of the LAN.  This is only half of the trip a packet must
      take.  The packet will also traverse the switch to the
      destination node which may have a lower bandwidth.
  <li>If this command is not used to overwrite the bandwidth, then the
      bandwidth for a given node to switch link is taken directly from
      the bandwidth passed to <code>make-lan</code>.
  <li>The behavior of this command is not defined when used with nodes
      that are in the same LAN multiple times.
</ul>

<a name="tb-set-node-lan-loss"></a><h4>tb-set-node-lan-loss</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-node-lan-loss <i>node</i> <i>lan</i> <i>loss</i>

tb-set-node-lan-loss $node0 $lan0 0.05
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The node we are modifying the loss for.
  <dt><i>lan</i> - Which LAN the node is in that we are affecting.
  <dt><i>loss</i> - The new node to switch loss (see below).
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command changes the loss probability between the node and the
      switch of the LAN.  This is only half of the trip a packet must
      take.  The packet will also traverse the switch to the
      destination node which may also have a loss chance.  Thus for
      packet going to switch with loss chance <var>A</var> and then
      going on the destination with loss chance <var>B</var> the node
      to node loss chance is
      <code>(1-(1-<var>A</var>)(1-<var>B</var>))</code>.
  <li>If this command is not used to overwrite the loss, then the
      loss for a given node to switch link is taken from the loss rate
      passed to the <code>make-lan</code> command.  If a loss rate of
      <var>L</var> is passed to <code>make-lan</code> then the node to
      switch loss rate for each node is set to
      <code>(1-sqrt(1-<var>L</var>))</code>.  Thus as each packet will
      have two such chances to be lost the node to loss rate comes out
      as the desired <var>L</var>.
  <li>The behavior of this command is not defined when used with nodes
      that are in the same LAN multiple times.
</ul>

<a name="tb-set-node-lan-params"></a><h4>tb-set-node-lan-params</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-node-lan-params <i>node</i> <i>lan</i> <i>delay</i> <i>bandwidth</i> <i>loss</i>

tb-set-node-lan-params $node0 $lan0 40ms 20Mb 0.05
</pre>

<dl>

<a name="VTYPE"></a><h3>Virtual Type Commands</h3>

<p>Virtual Types are a method of defining fuzzy types.  I.e. types
that can be fulfilled by multiple different physical types.  The
advantage of virtual types (vtypes) is that all nodes of the same
vtype will usually be the same physical type of node.  In this way,
vtypes allows logical grouping of nodes.

<p>As an example, imagine we have a network with internal routers
connecting leaf nodes.  We want the routers to all have the same
hardware, and the leaf nodes to all have the same hardware, but the
specifics do not matter.  We have the following
fragment in our NS file:

<pre>
...
tb-make-soft-vtype router {pc600 pc850}
tb-make-soft-vtype leaf {pc600 pc850}

tb-set-hardware $router1 router
tb-set-hardware $router2 router
tb-set-hardware $leaf1 leaf
tb-set-hardware $leaf2 leaf
</pre>

<p>Here we have set up two soft (see below) vtypes, router and leaf.
Our router nodes are then specified to be of type <i>router</i>, and the leaf
nodes of type <i>leaf</i>.  When the experiment is swapped in the testbed will
attempt to make router1 and router2 be of the same type, and
similarly, leaf1 and leaf2 of the same type.  However, the
routers/leafs may be pc600s or they may be pc850s, whichever is easier
to fit in to the available resources.

<p>As a basic use, vtypes can be used to request nodes that are all
the same type, but can be of any available type:

<pre>
...
tb-make-soft-vtype N {pc600 pc850}

tb-set-hardware $node1 N
tb-set-hardware $node2 N
...
</pre>

<p>Vtypes come in two varieties, hard and soft.  With soft vtypes, the
testbed will try to make all nodes of that vtype the same physical
type, but may do otherwise if resources are tight.  Hard vtypes behave
just like soft vtypes except that the testbed will give higher
priority to vtype consistency and swapping in will fail if the vtypes
can not be satisfied.  So, if you use soft vtypes you are more likely
to swap in but there is a chance your node of a specific vtype will
not all be the same.  If you use hard vtypes all nodes of a given vtype
will be the same, but swapping in may fail.

<p>Finally, you can have weighted soft vtypes.  Here you assign a
weight from 0 to 1 exclusive to your vtype.  The testbed will give
higher priority to consistency in the higher weighted vtypes.  The
primary use of this is to rank multiple vtypes by importance of
consistency.  Soft vtypes have a weight of 0.5 by default.

<p>As a final note, when specifying the types of a vtype, use the most
specific type possible.  For example: tb-make-soft-vtype router {pc
pc600}, is not very useful, as pc600 is a sub type of pc.  You may
very well end up with two routers as type pc with different hardware,
as pc covers multiple types of hardware.

  <dt><i>weight</i> - The weight of the vtype, 0 < <i>weight</i> < 1.
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>These commands create vtypes.  See notes above for description
      of vtypes and the difference between soft and hard.
  <li><code>tb-make-soft-vtype</code> creates vtypes with weight 0.5.
  <li>vtype commands must appear before <code>tb-set-hardware</code>
      commands that use them.
  <li>Do not used <code>tb-fix-node</code> with nodes that have a vtype.
</ul>

<a name="MISC"></a><h3>Misc. Commands</h3>

<a name="tb-fix-node"></a><h4>tb-fix-node</h4>

<pre>
tb-fix-node <i>vnode</i> <i>pnode</i>

tb-fix-node $node0 pc42
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>vnode</i> - The node we are fixing.
  <dt><i>pnode</i> - The physical node we want used.
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command forces the virtual node to be mapped to the
      specified physical node.  Swap in will fail if this can not be
      done.
  <li>Do not use this command on nodes that are a virtual type.
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-uselatestwadata"></a><h4>tb-set-uselatestwadata</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-uselatestwadata 0
tb-set-uselatestwadata 1
</pre>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command indicates which widearea data to use when mapping
  widearea nodes to links. The default is 0, which says to use the aged data.
  Setting it to 1 says to use the most recent data. 
</ul>


<a name="tb-set-wasolver-weights"></a><h4>tb-set-wasolver-weights</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-wasolver-weights <i>delay bw plr</i>

tb-set-wasolver-weights 1 10 500
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>delay</i> - The weight to give delay when solving.
  <dt><i>bw</i> - The weight to give bandwidth when solving.
  <dt><i>plr</i> - The weight to give lossrate when solving.
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command sets the relative weights to use when assigning widearea
  nodes to links. Specifying a zero says to ignore that particular
  metric when doing the assignment. Setting all three to zero results
  in an essentially random selection.
</ul>

<a name="tb-set-node-failure-action"></a><h4>tb-set-node-failure-action</h4>

<pre>
tb-set-node-failure-action <i>node action</i>

tb-set-node-failure-action $nodeA "fatal"
tb-set-node-failure-action $nodeB "nonfatal"
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><i>node</i> - The node name.
  <dt><i>action</i> - One of "fatal" or "nonfatal"
</dl>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This command sets the failure mode for a node. When an
  experiment is swapped in, the default action is to abort the swapin if
  any nodes fail to come up normally. This is the "fatal" mode. You
  may also set a node to "nonfatal" which will cause node bootup failures to
  be reported, but otherwise ignored during swapin. Note that this can
  result in your experiment not working properly if a dependent node
  fails, but typically you can arrange your software to deal with
  this. 
</ul>
