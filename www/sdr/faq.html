<div class="question">
<p>
  <a name="WhatIsSDR">What is software-defined radio (SDR)?</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
  Software-defined radio (SDR) is a system in which changeable
  software is used to process digital signals sent and/or
  received by accompanying radio frequency hardware.  This is in
  contrast to traditional radios, in which the signal processing
  logic is mainly hard-coded into custom hardware with only
  limited control over how the signal is handled.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
  <a name="WhatIsGNURadio">What is GNU Radio?</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
  GNU Radio is a free, extensible software kit for experimenting
  with software defined radio (SDR) that runs on a general-purpose
  computer, such as a PC or a Mac.  This software suite
  is normally coupled with hardware (such as the USRP) that
  captures radio frequency (RF) signals and converts them from
  analog to digital.  The GNU Radio software operates on this
  digital representation of the radio signal.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
  <a name="WhatIsUSRP">What is the Universal Software Radio Peripheral
  (USRP)?</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
  The Universal Software Radio Peripheral, or USRP for short, is
  a hardware platform designed to work with the GNU Radio
  software kit.  It is comprised of an extensible motherboard
  that can accommodate up to four peripheral daughtercards.
  digital to analog (D/A) and analog to digital (A/D) converters
  on the motherboard change the signal to and from digital as it
  passes between the the motherboard and daughtercards.  A
  programmable FPGA on the motherboard can perform mathematical
  transforms on the digital signals quickly.  Data is shuttled to
  and from the motherboard and general purpose computer through a
  USB&nbsp;2.0 connection.
</p>

<p>
  Several USRP daughtercards are already available, with many more
  planned.  These include a UHF receiver (50MHz&ndash;800MHz), basic
  transmit and receive boards for use with external equipment, and
  ISM band transmitters and receivers (e.g. 2.4GHz band).
