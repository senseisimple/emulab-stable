     <h3>Introduction</h3>

The <b>Testbed Master Control Daemon</b> (TMCD) is a program that runs
on <b>boss.emulab.net</b>, and provides configuration information to
Testbed nodes when they boot up. The <b>Testbed Master Control
Client</b> (TMCC), is a small program that is installed on each node,
and is used to connect to the TMCD to issue requests and get the
response. In addition, Testbed nodes use the TMCC/TMCD to communicate
events of interest back to the Emulab Database and to the user via the
Web interface. The TMCD interface is text based; clients issue
requests in the form of strings consisting of a command and an
optional argument. The response is also a string, in a very generic
format that can be easly parsed by any C/C++ program or shell
interpreter. For example, to determine how to configure the
experimental interfaces on each testbed node in your experiment when
it boots, you would do the following:

<code><pre>
tmcc ifconfig					</code></pre>

The response to this request would be:

<code><pre>
INTERFACE=1 INET=10.0.0.1 MASK=255.255.255.0
INTERFACE=2 INET=10.0.1.1 MASK=255.255.255.0	</code></pre>

which indicates that interfaces eth1 and eth2 (or perhaps fxp1 and
fxp2) should be configured to the given IP addresses and netmasks.

<p>
<li> <a NAME="TMCC"></a>
     <h3>TMCC</h3>

The <b>TMCC</b> is a simple client program that runs on the testbed
nodes and handles the details of connecting to the <b>TMCD</b>,
issuing the request, getting the response, and printing it out. It has
been compiled on FreeBSD 4.x, Redhat Linux 6.2 and 7.1, and Netbsd 1.4, and
should compile on just about any operating system. Alternatively, you
can integrate the TMCC into your own programs. Briefly, the TMCC
connects to port 7777 (UDP or TCP) on <b>boss.emulab.net</b>, writes a
single string to the connection, and then waits for an <b>optional</b>
response, which is a newline separated list of strings. The TMMC exits
when the other side of the connection is closed by the TMCD. The
source code for the TMCC is available upon request by sending email to
<a href="mailto:testbed-ops@flux.cs.utah.edu"> Testbed Operations
(testbed-ops@flux.cs.utah.edu)</a>

<p>
<li> <a NAME="SETUP"></a>
     <h3>Node Setup Script</h3>

The Emulab versions of FreeBSD 4.3, Redhat Linux 7.1, and Netbsd 1.4
all run a <i>setup</i> script at bootup that uses the TMCC client to
configure the node. All of the interfaces are configured, user
accounts for each of the members of the project are created, NFS
mounts are made, etc. These setup scripts are located in /etc/testbed
on FreeBSD and Netbsd, and in /etc/rc.d/testbed on Linux. You can use
these scripts as a guide when writing setup code to configure your
custom operating systems.

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REFERENCE"></a>
     <h3>Command Reference</h3>

<ul>
<li> <a NAME="REF-REBOOT"></a>
     <h3>reboot</h3>

Report that a node has rebooted to the TMCD. This is an informational
message that is used by the TMCD to determine when a node reboots for
the first time after its disk has been reloaded. No response is
returned. 

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-STATUS"></a>
     <h3>status</h3>

Request status information about the project and experiment that the
node is currently part of. Returns the project ID, experiment ID, and
the node <i>name</i> from the NS file that described the topology.
This command is typically used to determine if the setup script needs
to do any further configuration; if the node is free, then no other
information is going to be provided by the TMCD. The format of the
reply is one of:

<code><pre>
FREE
ALLOCATED=pid/eid NICKNAME=name			</code></pre>

The first form indicates that the node is not currently allocated to
an experiment. The second form says that the node is running as part
of the "eid" experiment in the "pid" project, and was named "name" in
the NS file that described the topology.

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-IFCONFIG"></a>
     <h3>ifconfig</h3>

Request the configuration information for each of the network
interfaces on the node, as determined by the topology described in the
NS file, and the assignment of IP addresses to interfaces that is
performed when the experiment is configured. The information that is
returned is typically converted into corresponding <tt>ifconfig</tt>
commands on the node. However, the information can be used in any
manner that is appropriate for the operating system that is running on
the node. The reply to this request is one or more lines in the
following format (in the unlikely case that the topology describes a
node with no network links, the response to this request will be null):

<code><pre>
INTERFACE=Z INET=X.X.X.X MASK=Y.Y.Y.Y MAC=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF </code></pre>

Which says that the network interface with MAC address "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
is assigned to IP address "X.X.X.X" with netmask "Y.Y.Y.Y". <em>The
INTERFACE specification is currently invalid, since there no way to achieve
a consistent ordering of interfaces between various operating systems.</em>
Rather, the MAC address is used to determine which interface to configure.
A utility program called <tt>/etc/testbed/findif</tt> is provided to map
the MAC address to an interface name suitable for use with the
<tt>ifconfig</tt> program. On Redhat 7.1, the setup script would take this
information and issue the following shell commands. 

<code><pre>
iface=`/etc/testbed/findif AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`
/sbin/ifconfig $iface inet X.X.X.X netmask Y.Y.Y.Y	</code></pre>

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-ACCOUNTS"></a>
     <h3>accounts</h3>

Request group and login account information for each of the project
members of the project that the experiment is running. This
information can be used to generate login accounts for project members
on each of the nodes in an experiment. The Emulab versions of FreeBSD,
Linux, and Netbsd all have stub password/group files that do not
contain any user accounts or groups. When a node first boots after
being allocated to an experiment, this command is used to find out
what accounts to build. The reply to this request is one or more lines of
group information, followed by one or more lines of login account
information:

<code><pre>
ADDGROUP NAME=pid GID=XXXX
ADDUSER  LOGIN=joe PSWD=ABCD UID=YYYY GID=XXXX ROOT=N NAME="Joe User" \
             HOMEDIR=/users/joe GLIST=ZZZ0,ZZZ1
</code></pre>

The <tt>ADDGROUP</tt> reply gives the name of the group and the
numeric <tt>gid</tt> for that group. The <tt>ADDUSER</tt> reply has
the following fields:

<blockquote>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class="nogrid">
<tr>
 <td><font size=4><tt>LOGIN</tt></td>
 <td>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</td>
 <td><font size=4>The user/account name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><font size=4><tt>PSWD</tt></td>
 <td>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</td>
 <td><font size=4>The <i>encrypted</i> password string, suitable for direct
  insertion into the password file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><font size=4><tt>UID</tt></td>
 <td>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</td>
 <td><font size=4>The numeric uid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><font size=4><tt>GID</tt></td>
 <td>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</td>
 <td><font size=4>The primary group for the user, as a numeric gid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><font size=4><tt>ROOT</tt></td>
 <td>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</td>
 <td><font size=4>Indicates whether the user should be granted
 root access by placing the user into the root group (wheel group on
 FreeBSD/NetBSD). </td> 
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><font size=4><tt>NAME</tt></td>
 <td>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</td>
 <td><font size=4>The full name of the user, suitable for
 insertion into the <i>gecos</i> field of the user's password entry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><font size=4><tt>HOMEDIR</tt></td>
 <td>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</td>
 <td><font size=4>The absolute path to be used for the home directory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><font size=4><tt>GLIST</tt></td>
 <td>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</td>
 <td><font size=4>A (possibly null) comma separated list of auxiliary
 group ids, as numeric gids.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

On Linux, this information would be converted into the following
commands:

<code><pre>
groupadd -g XXXX pid
useradd -u YYYY -g XXXX -p ABCD -G root,ZZZ0,ZZZ1 -d /users/joe -c "Joe User" joe
</code></pre>


<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-MOUNTS"></a>
     <h3>mounts</h3>

Request the list of remote directories that need to be NFS mounted on
the node when it boots. The reply to this request is one or more lines
in the following format:

<code><pre>
REMOTE=fs.emulab.net:/users/joe LOCAL=/users/joe
REMOTE=fs.emulab.net:/proj/testbed LOCAL=/proj/myproj		</code></pre>

On Linux, this information would be converted into the following
commands:

<code><pre>
mkdir /users/joe
/sbin/mount fs.emulab.net:/users/joe /users/joe
mkdir /proj/myproj
/sbin/mount fs.emulab.net:/proj/myproj /proj/myproj		</code></pre>


<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-RPMS"></a>
     <h3>rpms</h3>

Request the list of RPMs that should be installed on the node when it
boots, as specified in the NS file on a per-node basis.  The reply to
this request is null if there are no RPMs to install, or one or more
lines in the following format:

<code><pre>
RPM=/path/to/name.rpm					</code></pre>

On Linux and Freebsd, each RPM is installed with the <tt>rpm</tt>
command, which will install the RPM only if it has not already been
installed:

<code><pre>
rpm -i /path/to/name.rpm				</code></pre>

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-STARTUPCMD"></a>
     <h3>startupcmd</h3>

Request the name of the startup script (or program) that should be run
when the node boots, as specified in the NS file on a per-node basis.
The reply to this request is null if a startup script was not
specified, or a single line in the following format:

<code><pre>
CMD=/path/to/runme UID=joe				</code></pre>

Which says to run <tt>/path/to/runme</tt> as user <tt>joe</tt> when
the node boots. The UID is always the experiment creator. On FreeBSD,
Linux, and NetBSD, the command is run once the node is running
multiuser. If the node reboots before the experiment is terminated,
the command will be run again.

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-STARTSTATUS"></a>
     <h3>startstatus</h3>

Report the numeric exit value of the startupcmd back to the TMCD so
that it can be recorded and displayed in the "Experiment Information"
Web page. In fact, this does not have to be the result of the
startupcmd, but can be the result of any application program. The
intent is to report back information that can be used by the
experimentor to determine when the experiment has finished. Each node
reports back status individually. The format of this <b>command</b>
is:

<code><pre>
tmcc startstatus XX				</code></pre>

which sends the numeric value XX back to the TMCD. There is no
response from the TMCD to this command. 

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-READY"></a>
     <h3>ready</h3>

Report an application level <i>ready</i> status back to the TMCD so
that it can record it. A count of nodes (in your experiment) reporting
ready is maintained by the TMCD, and is made available to nodes via
the <tt>readycount</tt> request below. There is no response from the
TMCD to this command.

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-READYCOUNT"></a>
     <h3>readycount</h3>

Request the count of nodes that have reported in <i>ready</i> with the
<tt>ready</tt> command above. This is an application level count;
nodes can use this as a very primitive form of synchronization to
determine when all of the nodes in the experiment have started the
application (say, via the <tt>startupcmd</tt> above) and have reached
a point where it is necessary to wait until all of the nodes have
reached the same point. The reply to this request is a single line in
the following format:

<code><pre>
READY=N TOTAL=M				</code></pre>

which says that <tt>N</tt> nodes have reported in, of a total number
of <tt>M</tt> nodes in the experiment. The application can continue to
poll until <tt>N==M</tt>, but be sure to add some delay between each
poll to avoid livelock at the TMCD. Note that the ready count is
essentially a use-once feature; The ready count cannot be
reinitialized to zero since there is no actual synchronization
happening.  If in the future it appears that a generalized barrier
synchronization would be more useful, we will investigate the
implementation of such a feature.

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-HOSTNAMES"></a>
     <h3>hostnames</h3>

Request information about the IP addresses and node names of all of
the nodes in the experiment. The intent it to provide the ability to
easily generate a suitable <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> file that allows
experiments to operate using the symbolic names of the nodes (as
defined in the NS file), instead of IP addresses, which are generally
assigned by the configuration software, not the experimentor. Since
nodes can use multiple experimental interfaces, the reply gives the IP
address for each interface on each node. An additional alias is
returned for nodes that are directly connected to the node making the
hostnames request. Secondary interfaces, and interfaces that are not
directly connected are named with a -X suffix, where X is the ordinal
number of the interface. The reply to this request is one or more
lines in the following format:

<code><pre>
NAME=nodeA LINK=X IP=X.X.Y.A ALIAS=nodeA
NAME=nodeB LINK=Y IP=X.X.Y.B ALIAS=nodeB
NAME=nodeC LINK=Z IP=X.X.Z.C ALIAS=  			</code></pre>

The <tt>LINK</tt> field is the number of the network interface on the
destination node, that this node is connected to. The /etc/hosts file
that would be created for this response is:

<code><pre>
X.X.X.A        nodeA-X nodeA
X.X.X.B        nodeB-Y nodeB
X.X.Z.C        nodeC-Z					</code></pre>

Say that nodeA is making this request. NodeA is obviously connected to
itself, so it gets an alias pointing to its own interface. NodeA is
directly connected to NodeB on NodeB's <tt>Y</tt> interface, so it to
gets an alias so that an application running on nodeA can just use the
name NodeB. NodeC is not directly connected to NodeA (perhaps it is
connected to NodeB on one of NodeB's other interfaces), so it does not
get an alias. Refering to nodeC on nodeA would be confusing and
possibly incorrect.

<p>
<li> <a NAME="REF-LOG"></a>
     <h3>log</h3>

The <tt>log</tt> command can be used by an application to write a
message to a log file on <b>users.emulab.net</b>. This is especially
useful on the Sharks, most of which do not have console serial lines
attached. The argument to the log command is a single string, in
double quotes if operating within the shell:

<code><pre>
tmcc log "This is a log message"			</code></pre>

The log file is stored in <tt>/proj/pid/logs/eid.log</tt>, where
<tt>pid</tt> is the name of the project and <tt>eid</tt> is the name
of the experiment. The file is appended to each time; it is the
responsibility of the experimentor to zero the log file when done, or
if a new experiment with the same name is started. 

</ul>
</ul>
