    <body>
	An alternating space-separated list of the directory from which that
	untar should start, and the path to the tarball. You can supply either
	URLs from which we should fetch the tarballs, or paths to files on
	<code>users.emulab.net</code>.  For example:
	<blockquote>
	    <code>/somedir&nbsp;http://www.myU.edu/~me/mytarball.tar.gz</code>
	    <p>or</p>
	    <code>/somedir&nbsp;/proj/myproj/tarfiles/mytarball.tar.gz</code>
	</blockquote>
	These tarballs will be installed in all slivers in the slice, and you can push
	out updates to them while the slice is running.
