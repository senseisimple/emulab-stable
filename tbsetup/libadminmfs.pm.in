# Admin MFS library.  Routines related to getting into and out of the
# admin MFS and executing programs within it.
#
# Note that none of these routines are graceful about errors.  If some/all
# nodes fail, their bootinfo states may be modified and not all the same;
# i.e., some nodes may be set to boot into the MFS (or may even have booted
# into the MFS) and others not.  These routines are used primarily at swap
# out time where all inconsistent state will get fixed up anyway, or by
# node_admin where the caller is assumed to be saavy.
