# Need ssh transport proxy to chat with the new NM.  Until PLC deploys the
# "delegate" ssh login to the NM shell, we ssh to the utah svc slice as
# emulabman and talk to the NM ourselves.  Obviously, this won't work if
# there's no utah_svc_slice sliver on the target machine.  Once the delegate
# mechanism is introduced, this transport will still be useful.
