Parser README

Operation
---------

parse.tcl [-q] [-n] pid eid ns_file

-q - Quiet Mode - Omit messages about unsupported features.
-n - Impotent Mode - Do not update DB; just display any messages and exit.

parse.tcl will interpret the NS file including all TB commands and
update the virt_lans, and virt_nodes tables appropriately.  parse.tcl
also fills in any unassigned IP addresses.

The following objects exist in the top level namespace:

Namespaces: GLOBALS, TBCOMPAT
OTcl Classes: Link, Lan, LanLink, Node, Simulator, Null
Procedures: real_set, lpop, var_import, perror, new

In addition all the tb-* commands exist as top level procedures.

======================================================================

Everything that follows is written to provide a basic background for
understanding and modifying the code.

Basic Structure
---------------

The parser works by setting up an API nearly identical to that that NS
presents.  As the input file uses this API a topology is built up
internally.  The parser also extends the API with a number of testbed
specific commands.  These annotate the topology with additional
information.  Finally, when the 'run' method is invoked on the
simulator class, the parser fills in any unassigned IP addresses and
updates the database.

parse.tcl - This file checks arguments, loads the other files, and
defines common state.

tb_compat.tcl - This file contains the implementation of all the
testbed specific (tb-*) commands.

node.tcl - This defines the Node class.

lanlink.tcl - This defines the LanLink class and its two child classes
Lan and Link.

sim.tcl - This defines the Simulator class.

null.tcl - This defines the Null class which is used to allow
unsupported API calls.


Object Naming
-------------

The trickiest part of the parser is the way it names objects.  Since
the nodes, lans, and links created in the NS file have existence
outside of the parser and are visible to the user they must have
meaningful names.  The most intuitive name for an object is that of
the variable the holds the object.  I.e. the following command:

set router [$ns node]

should create a node named 'router'.  There is a difficulty however,
in that, the class instance is created before the assignment and thus
there is no way to create the class with the proper name.

The solution to this is to rename classes as part of the assignment.
This is accomplished by redefining the assignment operator, 'set'.  In
almost all cases 'set' behaves as normal.  However, when the Simulator
class creates a NS object (in make-lan, node, or duplex-link) it sets
the last_class globals variable to be the name of the just created
class.  The next call to 'set' will compare the value of the
assignment with the last_class variable.  If they match it will rename
the class to the name of the variable and then set the value of the
variable to its name.

Example:

set router [$ns node]

does the following:

1. Call 'node' method of the Simulator class.
  Creates a Node object with an internal name, say 'node1'.
  Set last_class variable to 'node1'.
  Return 'node1'
2. Call 'set' with variable of 'router' and value of 'node1'.
  As the value equals last_class this is not a normal assignment.
  Rename node1 to router.
  Set router variable to have value of 'router'.
  Clear last_class.
  Return 'router' (normal set behavior)

So after the statement completes there is a new Node instance named
'router' and the router variable has the value 'router'.  I.e.:

puts $router

will display "router" to stdout.

Renaming an object involves changing the name of the instance and
changing any references that were created during its creation.
Changing the name of the instance is easily done directly by 'set'.
In order to change references each class has a 'rename' method which
takes the old and the new name.  In addition each class involved and
the Simulator class have two other methods: rename_node and
rename_lanlink.  These two methods take an old and a new name and
should change any references they contain to the old name to now refer
to the new name.  Thus, the rename method calls the appropriate
rename_* method in all class instances that may refer to it.  

Example: The rename method of the Lan class looks something like this:

rename old new:
	sim rename_lanlink old new
	foreach node in members
		node rename_lanlink old new


Unsupported Methods/Classes
---------------------------

NS defines a large and rich API, most of which is not supported by the
testbed.  The parser allows for most of the API and displays warning
messages of unsupported features.  

In OTcl any class can define a 'unknown' method.  Any time a call to
an undefined method is made the 'unknown' method is called with the
method name and any arguments.  This is how the parser supports most
of the NS API.

In general the 'unknown' method returns a NULL value.  However,
methods of the Simulator class usually return class instances which
are used later in the NS file.  In order to support this an instance
to the Null class is created and returned.

The Null class defines only the 'unknown' method.  Thus any calls to
it will result in unsupported messages.

The 'new' procedure also always returns class instances.  Any calls to
'new' for classes that the parser does not know about will result in a
Null class being created and returned.

This approach allows nearly all NS API to be parsed without
duplicating large portions of the NS code.  It does, however, have the
failing that much more than the NS API is valid.  For example:

set foo [new bar]
$foo order_pizza now

set ns [new Simulator]
set myhouse [$ns house]
$myhouse open door for dog

are valid NS files.  However, both will result in several warning
messages.

Lans and Links
--------------

NS distinguishes between Lans and Links.  The Testbed however does
not.  I.e. the following two commands are equivalent:

set mylink [$ns duplex-link $n1 $n2 100Mb 50ms DropTail]
set mylink [$ns make-lan "$n1 $n2" 100Mb 50ms]

The parser works by having a single class LanLink which it uses in
both cases.  However, for type checking, it uses two children classes
of LanLink, Lan and Link.  Both classes makes no changes to LanLink.
They exist to provide a way for the various method and tb-* commands
to type check arguments.

Ports
-----

The parser has a concept of a virtual port.  These are simple integers
that start at 0 and go up as LanLinks are created and connected to
nodes.  The Node class defines 'add_lanlink' which connects a LanLink
to a node and returns the port number.  Whenever a port is directly
referred to it is by this number.  Virtual ports always start at 0 and
are continuous.


tb-* Commands
-------------

The file tb_compat.tcl should be loaded 'source tb_compat.tcl' by any
NS file that wishes to use them.  This allows NS files to still be run
in NS without modification merely by providing a different
tb_compat.tcl file.

The tb_compat.tcl file defines all the tb-* procedures.  Each
procedure checks its arguments and then modifies the topology
appropriately.  tb-* commands generally fall into three categories:

IP address: These commands all convert into calls to the internal
procedure 'set-ip'.  'set-ip' takes a node, a LanLink the node is
connected to, and an IP address, and sets the IP address for the
appropriate port on the node.

Node state: These commands after checking their arguments all set a
variable in the appropriate node instance.

Link state: These commands check their arguments, determine which
LanLink is being referred to, and set a variable in the LanLink
instance.  The Simulator class provides a 'find_link' method which
takes a source/destination pair and returns a link.  This method is
used by some of these commands to map such pairs.


IP Addresses
------------

As the NS file runs calls to tb-* commands will set the IP addresses
for some node:port pairs.  When the 'run' method of the Simulator
class is called any node:port's without IP addresses are assigned IP
addresses.  The algorithm attempts to insure that all IP addresses on
a LanLink are in the same subnet and that subnets are globally
unique.  

The 'run' method invokes a 'fill_ips' method on each LanLink.  If any
members of the LanLink have a defined IP the subnet is taken from this
IP.  Otherwise, the 'get_subnet' method of the Simulator is called to
get a unique subnet.  Then any unassigned IP addresses are assigned IP
addresses, starting at 2, and skipping any that are already used.

'get_subnet' creates subnets starting at 192.168.1 and going up,
skipping any that have already been used by tb-* commands.

There is a limitation of 253 nodes per LanLink due to the IP
algorithm.  LANs larger than this will need all their IP addresses
set manually via the tb-* commands.


Updating the DB
---------------

Every Node and LanLink defines an updatedb method which dumps its
state to the DB.  Each class instance corresponds to a single row in
either virt_nodes or virt_lans.
