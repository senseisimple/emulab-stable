# Simply a wrapper for the parser. Passes on its arguments to parse.tcl,
# which spits out some stuff, which the caller reads back. Typically,
# this is via ssh from boss, since we want to run the parser on ops.
# The input to this script (on stdin) is the NS file supplied by the user,
# prepended with some hand crafted TCL code to set up the initial state
# of the parser (DB state the parser needs in order to run).
#
# The first argument option is the user to run this script as, since we
# gets invoked by a root ssh from boss. This option is not passed onto
# the parser of course!
#
# When run in "impotent" mode, there is no output, just an exit code.
