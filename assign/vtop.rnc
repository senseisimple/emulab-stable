# Description of a virtual topology

default namespace = "http://emulab.net/resources/vtop/0.2"

#
# We include the common topology specification schema, but override a few
# elements
#
include "top.rnc" 

## "Legacy" assign node flags - will be replaced with properties, and in some
## cases, explicit links
NodeFlagSpec =
    ## Specify that this node is a subnode of another node. We MIGHT
    ## try to do this with properties in the future
    ## Valid for both virtual and physical nodes
    element subnode_of { text }?,
    ## Indicates that this node should never be considered identical to any
    ## other node. Could be done with a property
    ## Valid only for physical nodes
    element unique { empty }?,
    ## Indicates that virtual links must either all be trivial (loopback), or
    ## none of them must be. Possibly expressible with properties?
    element disallow_trivial_mix { empty }?

## A node in the topology
NodeSpec = element node { NodeContents }
  
NodeContents =
    ## Name of the node - each node name must be unique within the 
    ## top element
        attribute name { text },
		attribute assigned_to { text }?,
		attribute hint_to { text }?,
    ## Type specification - we use a named pattern here (defined below), so
    ## that it can be overriden in the virtual topology schema, where you are
    ## only allowed to have one
        NodeTypeSpec,
    ## Legacy flags
        NodeFlagSpec,
    ## Legacy features and desires
        FeatureDesireSpec*,
    ## Types of virtual nodes that this physical node can satisfy
    ## Desires of this node, which should (or must) be matched by the
    ## physical node we are assigned to
        PropertySpec*

## Links in the topology - zero or more
LinkSpec = element link { LinkContents }

LinkContents =
    ## Name of the link - must be unique in the top
        attribute name { text },
    ## The two interfaces which form the endpoints of this link.
        LinkEndPoints,
    ## The characteristics (bandwidth, latency, loss) which affect traffic.
        LinkCharacteristics,
    ## Type of this link - we use a named pattern here (defined below), so
    ## that it can be overriden in the virtual topology schema, where you are
    ## only allowed to have one
        LinkTypeSpec,
	## "Legacy" link flags used by assign. Will be replaced by properties
		LinkFlagSpec, 
	## The annotated link/path
		LinkMapping?,
    ## Properties of this link
        PropertySpec*

## The path to which a link has been mapped
## For the moment only 2 interface mappings are specified because
## every link only has 2 interfaces for the moment.
LinkMapping =
  element component_hop { 
		attribute assigned_to { text }, 
		InterfaceMapping, 
		InterfaceMapping 
  }+

# Each interface represents a particular physical interface. If that
# interface is one of the link end points, it is also mapped to that
# virtual node and its interface name.
InterfaceMapping = element interface {
  attribute physical_node_name { text }, 
  attribute physical_interface_name { text },
  attribute virtual_node_name { text }?,
  attribute virtual_interface_name { text }?
}


## Specify a virtual class - assign allows you to define classes for virtual
## nodes, and specify that all nodes using that class should, or must, be
## assigned to physical nodes of the same type
VclassSpec = element vclass {
    ## Name of the virtual class
    attribute name { text },
    ## Specify whether the vclass is hard (ie. all nodes *must* be of the same
    ## type) or soft (ie. violating it is allowed, but penalize)
    (element hard { empty } |
     (element soft { empty },
      element weight { xsd:float { minInclusive = "0.0" } } )),
	element physical_type { text }+
}

## "Legacy" link flags used by assign. Will be replaced by properties
LinkFlagSpec = 
    ## Indicates that it is not okay to use a delay node to artificially
    ## shape/delay traffic for this link. Replace by using type system.
    element nodelay { empty }?,
    ## Indicates whether it is okay to multiplex this link with other virtual
    ## links onto the same physical link (old name: emulated) Probably replace
    ## by using the type system (ie. have an 'Ethernet' type that can only
    ## hold one slot,  and an 'Ethernet-tagged' type that can hold more).
    element multiplex_ok { empty }?,
    ## Indicates whether it is okay to satisfy this link with a trivial
    ## (loopback) link. Replace using type system.
    element trivial_ok { empty }?,
    ## Gives the name of the interface that must be used to satisfy the source
    ## of this link - note that the interface name is given, not the node name
    element fixsrciface { string }?,
    ## Same as fixsrciface, for destination of the link
    element fixdstiface { string }?

## Virtual topology

    ## Project ID
    attribute pid { text },
