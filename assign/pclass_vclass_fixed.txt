Terminology:
	pnode = physical node
	vnode = virtual node
	pclass = physical equivalence class
	vclass = virtual equivalence class (vtype)

Physical Equivalence Classes

Two pnodes, A and B, are equivalent iff the following are true:

	1. A and B have identical type information.  Pnode type
information consists of a type and the number of vnodes of that type
that can fit in it.  For example, pc:1 pc850:1 delay:2, would allow a
pc OR a pc850 OR up to two delay nodes.

	2. A and B have identical features.  Feature information
consists of a feature and a cost. 

	3. A and B have identical links in terms of destination and
bandwidth.  I.e. if A has a link to X of bandwidth W then so must B,
and vice versa.

This defines an equivalence relation which is used to partition the
physical nodes into equivalence classes.


Each equivalence class contains, for every type its nods have, a list
of all the nodes of that type that are available.  When assign wants a
pnode to assign to it takes the first node from the appropriate list.
This pnode is then removed from all the *other* lists.  If the pnode
is full, i.e. no more vnodes can fit in it, then it is also removed
from the list of its type; otherwise it is left at the front of that
list.  In this way assign will fill up nodes before moving on to empty
nodes.  In a similar way when a pnode is unassigned, if it is now
empty it is added to the end of all lists in its pclass.  Otherwise it
is only added to the *beginning* of the list of its current type.


Example:

Say pc8 is a pnode of type pc:1 pc850:1 delay:2.

Let [pc1] be its pclass (pclasses are named by a representative member).

[pc1] has three lists, pc, pc850, and delay.  Let's say pc8 is at the
front of all of those lists.

Assign is going along and is trying to find a match for a vnode node1
of type pc.  Assign ends up choosing [pc1] as the pclass to match
node1 to.  It looks at the front of the pc list in [pc1] and finds
pc8.  It maps node1 to pc8.  As pc8 can only have a single pc vnode in
it, pc8 is removed from all three lists in [pc1].  If, later on, pc8
is unassigned, as it is then empty, it will be added to the end of all
three lists.

Let's say, instead, assign was trying to match a vnode delay1 of type
delay and chose [pc1].  It would find pc8 at the front of the delay.
In this case, however, pc8 is not full, it can hold another vnode of
type delay.  It is removed from the pc and pc850 lists but left at the
front of the delay list.  If later on another delay node is mapped to
pc8 then it will be removed from the delay list.  When being
unassigned pc8 will be added to the front of the delay list if it had
two delay nodes when it was unassigned.  If it only contained one then
it will be added to the end of all three lists.


Assign charges a cost for every pclass used.  In other words it
attempts to minimize the number of pclasses used.  This causes
solutions to tend to have nodes of the same type.


As part of the implementation of pclasses, assign switched from
choosing any pnode at all to try, to choosing a pclass that had nodes
of the right type.  This was not only a conversion from pnode to
pclass, but also from any to "of the right type".  The result of this
is that adding nodes that could not be part of the solution has no
effect.


VClasses or VTypes
------------------

VClasses and VTypes are the same thing.  VClass is the name used only
in assign for various reasons, and VTypes is used everywhere else.

Similar to PClasses grouping pnodes, VClasses group vnodes.  VClasses
are explicitly specified in the virtual topology.  Each VClass
contains a list of possible types, a bunch of vnodes, and a weight.
The idea is that assign will try very hard to make all of those vnodes
the same type.

The way this works is based on the idea of a dominant type.  Each
vclass has a dominant type, being the type most of its assigned
members are. 

When assign is mapping a vnode that belongs to a vclass it first
chooses a type for it from the possible types of its class.  If there
is a dominant type then it tends to choose that type but may choose
another (randomness is the essence of simulated annealing).  As long
as all the assigned nodes of a vclass are the same type nothing is
done to the score.  Whenever a vclass contains assigned nodes of
different types its weight is added to the score.  This weight is
added once per vclass, not once per member.  If the weight is greater
or equal to one a violation is also generated whenever the members are
of different types.

As the annealing progresses valid solutions where the vclasses are
consistent (all assigned members of the same type) will have lower
scores than valid solutions with inconsistent vclasses.  However, if
no valid solution with consistent vclasses exists then assign will
tend to the solution with the minimum number of inconsistent vclasses.

The weights of the vclasses can be used to rank them.  In cases where
no solution with consistent vclasses exists, solutions where higher
ranked vclasses are consistent will be favored.


Fixed Nodes
-----------

Fixed nodes allow the user to manually specify part of the mapping
themselves.  In implementation they are basically a special case.  A
node that is fixed is mapped before annealing begins and simply never
unmapped.
