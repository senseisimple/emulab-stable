## Representation of a single node type

	## Name of the type - will almost certainly not be unique
	attribute type_name { text },
	## How many virtual nodes of this type this physical node can
	## handle.
	attribute type_slots { xsd:integer { minInclusive = "0" } | "unlimited" },
		##element unlimited { empty }?,
	## A flag that indicates that this physical node *always*
	## has this type - a node is only allowed to have one dynamic
	## (ie. not flagged as static) type at a time, but any number
	## of static types at a time
	## element static { empty }?
	attribute static { "true" }?

## Link types are currently just a siple string. They will almost certainly 
## have to get more complicated, for two reasons:
##     First, I want to allow virtual links to specify more than one type, so
##       that we can ask for links that are, say, 'ethernet or loopback'
##     Second, I want to have a lot more control over links that get mapped to
##       multi-hop paths

## A link has two endpoints. Right now, they are order
## independent. But they might become order-dependant later.

    ## (ie. 0.01 == 1%)
