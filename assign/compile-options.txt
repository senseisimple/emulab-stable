This file documents the compile-time options for assign, and known caveats.

Clearly, there are WAY too many of these! Many of these can/should be make into
runtime options, or eliminated altogether.

Debugging/Extra Output
----------------------
VERBOSE			Like the name suggests...
DEBUG_TSTEP		Print debugging information about temperature steps
STATS                   Print some stats each step - similar to DEBUG_TSTEP
PCLASS_DEBUG		Print out pclasses once they've been determined
GRAPH_DEBUG		Print out the switch graph
DUMP_GRAPH		Print out the physical graph
ROB_DEBUG		Rob's very own debugging output - miscellaneous junk
SCORE_DEBUG		Print some messages about certain scoring events
SCORE_DEBUG_LOTS	Print virtual and physical nodes/links being scored
SCORE_DEBUG_MORE        Print every time we add or subtract the score!
GNUPLOT_OUTPUT		Create scores.out, temp.out, delta.out, which are
			written every time a transition is accepted, in a form
			that gnuplot likes
VIZ_LINK_LABELS		When producing graphviz output, label the links

Cooling Schedule Options
------------------------

These four constitute the new, from the literature, cooling schedule:
MELT			Start with a melting phase, in which we accept all
			transitions, and decide on an initial temperature.
			Standard SA stuff.
CHILL			Rather than a simple multiplicative decrease in 
			temperature, uses a function from the literature that
			picks the new temperature based on the score change
			in the previous temperature stop
NEIGHBOR_LENGTH		Base the length of the Markov chains on the approximate
			size of the neighborhood structure - simply the number
			of vnodes * the number of pclasses
EPSILON_TERMINATE	Use a delta function, which is compared against a
			constant, epsilon, to determine when we're done, instead
			of stopping at a static temperature

PHYS_CHAIN_LEN		Make the length of Markov chains (iters. at each
			temperature step) dependent on the size of the physical
			graph. Not for use with the new cooling schedule
USE_OPTIMAL		Exit early if we hit a lower bound we've computed on
			the score. Not very maintainable, so not recommended
TIME_TERMINATE		Add support for terminating after a given time - bad,
			because it doesn't alter the cooling schedule at all
TIME_TARGET		Better than TIME_TERMINATE, because it times the melting
			run and then does a simple multiplicative decrease
			cooling schedule, attempting to hit the target time. Not
			very accurate
LOCAL_DERIVATIVE	Use the local derivative for EPSILON_TERMINATE - default
			is to use the total temperature delta divided by the
			total temperature delta
ALLOW_NEGATIVE_DELTA    I was having some trouble with EPSILON_TERMINATE -
			the average score was getting temporarily worse by
			a small amount, causing early termination. If this
			variable is not set, the delta function must be
			positive for it to trigger termination
LOW_TEMP_STOP		Stop at a lower-than-normal temperature. Not for use
			with the new cooling schedule
RANDOM_ASSIGNMENT	Perform a pseudo-random assignment by exiting as soon
			as we get violation-free solution
REALLY_RANDOM_ASSIGNMENT Like RANDOM_ASSIGNMENT, but exits even if there are
			violations
FINISH_HILLCLIMB	When we would normally terminate, go back to the best
			solution and keep going for a while - the idea is to
			do a hillclimb from there. Seems like a good idea, but
			not well tested

SA Mechanics Options
--------------------
NO_REVERT		Normal behavior is to revert to the best solution at
			the end of each temperature step. This is somewhat
			questionable, so setting this disables it. You should
			set REVERT_LAST if this is set!
REVERT_LAST		Revert to best solution at the end of the last
			temperature step - only needed with NO_REVERT
REVERT_VIOLATIONS	Exclusive with  NO_REVERT - revert at the end of the
			temperature step if the best solution has fewer
			violations, but ignore the score
PCLASS_SIZE_BALANCE	Weight pclasses by size, instead of giving them equal
			weights, so that we're more likely to pick a pclass
			that has more members. Of dubious value
FIND_PNODE_SEARCH	To find a pnode, assign normally picks the first one
			in a pclass - this can cause problems, since this
			can result in a pclass getting 'stuck' - all attempts
			to map to it fail, because the front pnode has vnodes
			assigned to it that prevent mapping. This option causes
			a linear search through the pnode members for one that
			can be used. Theoretically can increase runtime, but
			in practice, does not, and fixes otherwise unmappable
			topologies.
LOAD_BALANCE		Normally, when multiplexing, assign tends to minimize
			the number of pnodes used. This option attempts (with
			limited success) to load-balance across the smallest
			number of pnodes possible instead. Requires
			FIND_PNODE_SEARCH . Intended for ModelNet-type mapping
FIX_LAN_NODES		Normally, LAN nodes are annealed just like normal nodes.
			This option treats them like fixed nodes - they are only
			moved during LAN migration. Not clear if this is a good
			idea or not, so it's off by default
AUTO_MIGRATE		Performs LAN migration every time a node in the LAN is
			re-assigned. This is quite heavyweight, so it increases
			runtime quite a bit, and doesn't seem to improve scores
			that much. Probably, LAN migration should be made more
			lightweight so that this can be turned on without much
			computation time penalty
FREE_IMMEDIATELY	When assign picks a vnode to re-map, it waits until
			after finding a replacement pnode to free the original
			mapping. This solves the exact-fit problem in which
			nodes being remapped always pick the old mapping again,
			since the just-freed pnode is the only one free. This
			option reverts to the old behavior, in which the unmap
			is done immediately, before picking a new pnode
ALLOW_TRIVIAL_DEFAULT   The new behavior for trivial links is that a vlink must
			be specially marked in order for assign to be allowed to
			satisfy it with a trivial link. This reverts to the old
			behavior in which all vlinks are allowed to be mapped to
			trivial links by default.
PER_VNODE_TT		Normally, assign keeps a 'type table' indicating which
			pnodes are potential matches by type - eg., there is
			a list of all pc850 nodes. This option builds this table
			for each node, instead of for each type. This helps
			greatly when there are nodes of the same type, but with
			different numbers of interfaces. Also provides some
			helpful information up-from about which nodes cannot
			be mapped, and could be used to prune down the size of
			the search space, since we can ignore nodes that are not
			in any node's TT.

Scoring Options
---------------
NO_VIOLATIONS		Removes special treatment for violations - we still keep
			track of them, but they don't affect whether a solution
			is accepted. Makes assign behave more like traditional
			simulated annealing
FIX_PLINK_ENDPOINTS	Allows the 'fixends' option to a plink that specifies
			that all vlinks mapped to that plink must have endpoints
			on the same pnodes - essentially, an interface can only
			talked to one other interface. Useful for ModelNet-type
			mapping, and potentially useful for jails, vlinks, and
			NSE
FIX_PLINKS_DEFAULT	Makes the 'fixends' option the default on all plinks.
			Requires FIX_PLINK_ENDPOINTS
PENALIZE_UNUSED_INTERFACES Apply a penalty for every interface not used. Should
			favor not wasting interfaces, but its affects on the
			overall scoring function are not well-studied
NO_PCLASS_PENALTY	Turn off the penalty for using pclasses - intended to
			get consistent scores between runs using and not using
			pclasses
INTERSWITCH_LENGTH	Scale the cost for using interswitch links by the length
			of the interswitch path. ie. if a a vlink crosses from
			a first switch, through a second, to a third, it incurs
			the interswitch penalty two times. Without this option,
			assign only assesses the penalty once, no matter how
			long the interswitch path
PENALIZE_BANDWIDTH	Penalize based on the bandwidth of links that, for
			example, cross interswitch links, not just the number
			of links. Will need to be in place when we do gigabit,
			but not well tested yet
TRIVIAL_LINK_BW		Allow, in the ptop file, specification of how much
			bandwidth can be used on the node for trivial links
