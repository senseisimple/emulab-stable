#
# Firewall rule template.
#
# The bulk of the line is the body of an IPFW rule, a '#' denoted "comment"
# at the end of the line indicates a rule number to use, and a comma
# separated list of styles to which the rule applies.
#
# Styles:
#
#	OPEN		allows everything
#	CLOSED   	allows only Emulab infrastructure services
#	BASIC		CLOSED + ssh from anywhere
#	ELABINELAB	Elab-in-elab, eliminates many Emulab services
#	WINDOWS		Rules specific to WinXP, not a real style right now
#			these are usually incorporated into the BASIC rules.
#
# Variables expanded by rc.firewall script that can be used here:
#
#	EMULAB_GWIP	IP address of gateway
#	EMULAB_NS	IP address of name server
#	EMULAB_CNET	Node control network in CIDR notation
#	EMULAB_MCADDR	Multicast address range used by frisbee
#	EMULAB_MCPORT	Port range used by frisbee
#	EMULAB_BOSSES	Comma separated list of subbosses (including "boss"),
#			used for services that subbosses provide
#			(dhcp/tftp/frisbee).
#
# Currently these are sufficient for rules we use.  Note that you can
# safely use symbolic hostnames "boss", "ops", "fs", "users", "ntp1"
# and "ntp2" as they are all guaranteed to resolve, either via the local
# hosts file or via DNS (assuming the firewall is not yet up or allows
# DNS traffic, which it should at that point in time).
#
# For an Emulab in Emulab setup, the names "myboss", "myops" and "myfs"
# are also valid for naming the respective inner servers.
#
# There are a few idioms that can be used in rules.  These are dependent
# on the exact configuration of the bridge and firewall, so be careful
# (see NOTES for details on the implementation and implications):
#
# "layer2"
#	A packet passing through the bridge.
# "not layer2"
#	A packet from or to the firewall itself.
# "in via vlan0"
#	Coming from the inside network.
# "in not via vlan0"
#	Coming from the outside network.
# "out"
#	Outbound from the firewall.
# "layer2 ... in via vlan0"
#	Traveling from inside to outside through the bridge.
# "layer2 ... in not via vlan0"
#	Traveling from outside to inside through the bridge.
# "from me to any out via vlan0"
#	IP traffic from firewall to the inside network.
# "from me to any out not via vlan0"
#	IP traffic from firewall to the outside network.
# "from any to me in via vlan0"
#	IP traffic to the firewall from inside.
# "from any to me in not via vlan0"
#	IP traffic to the firewall from outside.
#
# Questions, comments and warnings (refer to the NOTES file for more):
#
# 1. The rules use stateful checking via dynamic rules.  In addition to
#    being subject to DoS attacks, they can wreak havoc if the firewall
#    reboots.  In the case of the latter, all your TCP connections will
#    be toast.  Despite this, dynamic rules allow us to be a little more
#    constraining on what we allow through.
#
# 2. How much should we protect the firewall itself?  We disallow complete
#    access from inside.  From outside, we treat the firewall pretty much
#    like a firewalled node, except that we always allow infrastructure
#    services (e.g. NFS).
#
# 3. Watch out for VLAN tagged packets.  We don't want to process them
#    when they come in off the phys interface, we want to process them
#    when they have been untagged.
#

##
## COMMON RULES (2-9)
## These rules apply to all packets
##

#
# Match existing dynamic rules very early
#

#
# Anything that traverses the bridge will appear as layer2.
# Skip the firewall-specific rules for this common case.

##
## FIREWALL SPECIFIC RULES (10-79)
## These rules are for IP packets only.
##

#
# Nobody on the inside can talk to the firewall.
# Prevents anyone spoofing "me", "boss", "ops", etc.
#

#
# XXX early on in Emulab setup boss will ssh in and insert a rule at the
# beginning to allow all traffic.  Later we ssh in again to remove that rule.
# In order for the latter ssh command to complete, we have to make sure that
# an established connection to boss continues to work.

## BRIDGE SPECIFIC RULES (80-99 cannot be changed by user, 100 and higher can).
## These rules are for packets passing through the bridge.
##

#
# Disallow non-IP traffic.
#
# In particular, this prevents ARP.
#
deny not mac-type ip				# 80: BASIC,CLOSED,ELABINELAB

#
# No one on the inside can talk to other experiments' nodes and visa-versa.
#
# XXX currently we only do this for the heavier weight firewalls because
# the user cannot override this.
#
# Note that this does not apply to nodes within this experiment because
# those packets never come to the firewall.
#
# Note also that EMULAB_CNET is only the "node control net" and does not
# include the public/private nets for boss, ops, etc.
#
# XXX yuk!  The gateway *is* part of EMULAB_CNET, and assorted packets do
# come from it:
#  * IGMP and PIM traffic
#  * DHCP replies from boss appear to have come from the gateway
#    (due to the helper function).
# so for now we allow any IP traffic from the gateway.
#
allow ip from EMULAB_GWIP to any in not via vlan0	# 83: CLOSED,ELABINELAB
deny ip from any to EMULAB_CNET in via vlan0		# 84: CLOSED,ELABINELAB

#
# Inside nodes cannot spoof other IP addresses.
#
# Beyond this rule we no longer have to check to make sure that source
# hosts like "boss" and "ops" come in the correct interface.

#  * boss mcasts blocks to same mcaddr/port: 60047
#  * boss unicasts join replies to same port: 60048
#  * node and switch need to IGMP: 60049
#
# Elabinelab should only do this to download an image from real boss to
# the inner boss.  Re-imaging anything else from outside would be a disaster.
# But note that the image is still mcast, so we cannot really differentiate
# in 60047.
#
# NOTE: the unicast join replies (60048) make our life miserable. We cannot
# use a keep-state rule because the request was multicast and not directed to
# boss. Thus we have to open up a wide range of ports from boss for the reply.
# To make matters worse, this wide range potentially overlaps with rule 60067
# which allows TFTP traffic. Since the latter requires bi-directional traffic,
# we DO need to specify keep-state on this rule. If we ever start mcasting
# join replies, we could get rid of rule 60048 (which is why it is split out
# from 60047).
