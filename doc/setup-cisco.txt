##### Configuration suggestions for Cisco switches
#####

This file contains some configuration guidelines that we (Utah) have found
useful to improve the performance of our Cisco switches.

All commands given are to be typed at the (enable) prompt on your cisco
switches. They are for CatOS - switches that run IOS may not have these
commands.

<ports> means a list of ports, which on the CatOS command line, can include
lists and rages, such as "3/1,3/2" or "3/1-48" or "3/1-48,4/1-48,5/1-48"

##### Allowing ports to come up quicker

This one is useful on both the experimental and control nets:
    set spantree portfast <ports> enable
Use this on all ports that are directly connected to nodes, servers, power
controllers - anything that is not another switch. Normally, the switch waits
a while (several seconds) when a port first comes up before forwarding traffic
from this port - it does so to prevent loops in the switch topology. The main
place you will see the benefit of this is on the control net - with portfast
disabled, the first few DHCP packets sent by booting nodes will get dropped,
causing the DHCP to take much longer than necessary.

##### Reducing stray traffic

Disable spanning tree (STP.) If on, STP sends out packets approximately every
two seconds on every port. You can disable it on all VLANs with the command
    set spantree disable all
There are two major consequences (for our purposes) of disabling STP:
    1) You cannot have _any_ loops in your switch topology, or bad things will
	happen.
    2) VLAN pruning on trunks won't work, causing broadcast traffic to be
	forwarded across trunks that it does not need to cross. We've added
	features to snmpit to manually do STP's job in this case, so this
	problem is taken care of.
You must have STP disabled on _all_ switches that are trunked together! If it
is enabled on even one, STP traffic will be seen on all of them. 

The switch doesn't trust you to use portfast responsibly. So, it has a
'bpdu-guard' feature that helps guard against loops. Turn off this feature
with the command:
    set spantree portfast bpdu-guard disable

Cisco uses a protocol called 'CDP' to discover other Cisco devices. This sends
out small packets every two minutes. You can disable it with:
    set cdp disable <ports>
Ideally, you should only disable CDP on ports that don't have other Cisco 
devices attached, but in practice, running with CDP disabled on all ports is
fine.

Switch ports will, by default, try to negotiate trunking and channeling.
Cisco provides a handy macro:
    set port host <ports>
to disable both of these. Also enables portfast on the ports.

##### Setting MAC address aging time

We have found that some experimenters use applications, kernels, etc. that only
receive traffic, not send it. This presents a problem, because it prevents the
switch from learning which port the node is on, and thus broadcasting traffic
for it to every port in the VLAN. This can be solved by 'priming' - ie. having
the receive-only node send some traffic (like an ARP response) at the beginning
of the experiment. However, the default aging time of 300 seconds makes this
impractical. So, we have disabled this aging, making learned MACs permanent
(until the VLAN is torn down.)

You must do this for each VLAN, with the command:
    set cam agingtime <vlan> 0
For convenience, we've supplied a file (in this directory) called
'no-cam-aging.cfg' that disables aging on VLANs 2-999 (the ones potentially
used by our software.) Transfer this file to the switch using the:
    copy tftp config
command.

We also suggest that you do this on your control network as well - part of the
booting process leaves the nodes sitting dormant at a boot loader for extended
periods of time, so the switch will tend to forget their MACs.  Turning off
aging is not critical, but we suggest it, because it will reduce stray traffic
while the switch re-learns MAC addresses.

##### Setting up multicast between multiple switches

If you have more than one switch on the experimental or control networks, you
may need to do a little setup to get multicast between them. The symptom of
this problem is that multicast doesn't work between two nodes on different
switches, and if you run 'show multicast groups' on each switch, some will show
the group as existing, and others will not.

Run the following command for both sides (ie. on both switches) of every trunk
link:
set multicast router 1/1
(assuming that port 1/1 is your trunk link). If you are using EtherChannel to
bond together multiple links to form a single trunk, you only need to run this
command for the first port in the channel.

We had some problems running this command on the trunk on one of our switches:
it failed with the error:
Failed to add port 2/1 to multicast router port list.
What I finally did to resolve this was to tear down the trunk link and
EtherChannel that port was a part of, run the command on it (which succeeded
this time), and then build the EtherChannel and trunk back up.

##### Setting the clock

Since bos is an NTP server, you should set your switches to sync time with it.
On CatOS, this is accomplised with:
set ntp server 10.11.12.1
set ntp timezone MST -7
set ntp summertime MDT
set ntp summertime enable
set ntp summertime recurring
set ntp client enable
show time

Of course, you'll need to replace 10.11.12.1 with the IP address your boss node
uses to talk to the switches (usually its control-hardware interface), and
'MST', -7, and 'MDT' with the names of your timezone and its offset from GMT.
If you don't use daylight-savings time, leave out the 'summertime' steps, and
instead do:
set ntp summertime enable

Watch the output of 'show time' for a while to make sure the clock syncs up.
It may take a few minutes.

On IOS, these commands are:
configure terminal
ntp server 10.11.12.1
clock timezone MST -7
clock summer-time MDT recurring
exit

...  and to see the current time, run 'show clock'

##### IOS commands

The above commands are given under the assummption that your switches are
running CatOS. If you are running IOS, here are a few notes that may help you
'translate' the above commands.

Interfaces in CatOS are named as module/port, while interfaces in IOS are named
as TypeModule/Port - For example, if module 1 has gigabit interfaces, what you
call 1/1 in CatOS is Gi1/1 in IOS. 100Mbit Ethernet is 'Fa'. (Really, these are
'GigabitEthernet' and 'FastEthernet' respectively, but you can abbreviate them.)

In order to operate on many interfaces at once, you can issue configuration
commands like this:
range gi1/1 - 48, gi2/1 - 48, gi3/1 - 48
... which would configure all 48 Gigabit interfaces on modules 1, 2, and 3.

The equivalent of 'set port host' (which sets portfast, disabled BPDU guard,
etc.) is:
switchport host
... applied to an interface or a range of interfaces. As in:
interface range gi1/1 - 48, gi2/1 - 48, gi3/1 - 48
switchport host
exit

In order to disable spanning tree, you would use:
no spanning-tree vlan 1-1005

In order to create a VLAN and set its name:
vlan 10
name control-hardware
exit

In order to set the IP address of the interface in VLAN 10:
interface vlan 10
ip address 10.11.13.183 255.255.255.0
exit

In order to enable an interface:
interface vlan10
no shutdown
exit

In order to remove a VLAN:
no vlan 1000

To put an interface into a VLAN:
interface gi0/1
switchport access vlan 10
exit

In order to turn on trunking for an interface:
interface gi0/1
switchport mode trunk
exit

In order to turn off trunking for an interface:
interface gi0/1
switchport mode access
exit

In order to put interfaces into an EtherChannel:
interface range gi1/41 - 48
channel-group 1 mode on
exit

(Notes: If you want to make more than one channel, give each set of ports
a different channel number. And, now, you will configure the whole channel
as 'interface port-channel 1')

To set the native VLAN on a trunk:
interface gi0/1
switchport trunk native vlan 1

To set the read-write SNMP community string to 'public':
snmp-server community public rw

To globally disable the Cisco Router Discovery (cdp) protocol:
no cdp run
