  Log:
  Give assign the ability to make dynamic pclasses. Here's how it works:
  After building the set of pclasses normally, we make another pass
  through the vnodes. The goal to create a pclass for each individual
  node. We disable the node's 'own' pclass to begin with. Then, the
  _first_ time it gets a vnode mapped to it, we remove it from the
  'regular' pclass it belongs to, and enable it's own pclass. Then, if
  it goes empty, we put it back in its regular pclass and disable it's
  own.
  
  The point of this is to replace -p for use with multiplexed nodes.
  Instead of disabling pclasses altogheter, which has serious
  performance implications, we can instead be smart about which pnodes
  remain equivalent (because nothing's been mapped to them), and which
  are now different. The result is that on my test topoloy, the time to
  get a good mapping has gone from over 3 minutes to about 6 seconds.
  
  This feature is enabled with the -d option, and the -P option is
  pretty much mandatory when using it, since it greatly exacerbates the
  problem of cruft in the ptop file.
  
  This satisfies #14 from the todo file:
  14.  do dynamic pclasses
  
  Also bumped up the minimum neighborhood size from 500 to 1000. In some
  tests I was doing, this resulted in better solutions.

  Log:
  Major changes to the way assign handles LAN nodes.
  
  LAN nodes are no longer treated specially. Instead, I've introduced
  the idea of 'static' types (old-style types retroactively become
  'dynamic' types). While a pnode can only satisfy one dynamic type at a
  time, it can always satisfy its static types (assuming it has enough
  capacity left.) Static types are flagged by prepending them with a '*'
  in the ptop file. So, for example, you may give switches the
  '*lan:10000' type so that they can satisfy virtual LAN nodes. Of
  course, other pnodes can have this type too, so that we can get
  'trivial LANs'.
  
  Actually, removing special treatment for LANs cleans up a lot of code.
  However, it may have some negative impacts on solutions, since we're
  not as smart about where to place LAN nodes as we used to be (they get
  annealed along with everything else, and not migrated.) I haven't seen
  any evidence of this yet, however.
  
  This leaves us with a single type of special pnode, a switch.
  
  Also added a new bit of syntax in ptop files - when '*' is given as a
  the maxiumum load for a type, the node is allowed to take on an
  infinite (well, actually, just a really big number of) vnodes of that
  type.
  
  ptopgen was modified to always report switches as being capable of
  hosting LANs, and assign_wrapper now understands direct links to LANs,
  which is what we get when the LAN is hosted directly on a switch.
  
  Fixed a bug in scoring direct links, in which the penatly was being
  added once when a direct link was mapped, but subtracted only once
  when it was freed.
  
  Added a '-T' option for doing simple self-testing. When adding a node
  to the solution, assign records the score, adds the node, removes it
  again, and checks to make sure that the resulting score is the same as
  the original score. The usefulness of this feature in debugging
  scoring problems cannot be understated...

  Add support for idleswapping an experiment as the creator of the
  experiment, rather than as an administrator, which presents group
  permission problems when the experiment is in a subgroup (requires two
  additional group, whereas suexec adds only one group). That aside, the
  correct approach is to run the swap as the creator. To do that, must
  flip to the user (from the admin person) in the backend using the new
  idleswap script, and then run the normal swapexp. Add new option to
  swapexp (-i) which changes the email slightly to make it clear that
  the experiment was idleswapped, and so that the From: is tbops not the
  user (again, to make it more clear).

    account              quotamail.in 
  Log:
  Add new script to notify users when they are over their quota. Runs from
  cron daily, on the fs node (ops) as root. Uses lots of configure variables
  so that it does the right thing in any installation, without any
  customization.
  
  One possible caveat regarding quotas: If FS_NODE != USERNODE, they don't
  have a login on the fs machine. So checking their quota won't work unless
  the rpc.rquotad(8) daemon is running on FS_NODE, which we currently don't
  do.
  
  In order to do this right, I had to add a new configure var,
  FS_WITH_QUOTAS, that has a space separated list of file systems that have
  quotas enabled. (Ie the default is 'FS_WITH_QUOTAS="/q /users"'.) It
  doesn't have any default, since I couldn't come up with a reasonable one.
  All the defs files have been updated appropriately to define this new
  variable.

  Semi-major frisbee overhaul:

  Implement PREQUEST message which passes a bit map of desired blocks.
  We still use the REQUEST message (start block + number of blocks) for
  full chunk requests as that is more efficient.

  Allow dynamic number of variable-sized write buffers.  Total memory
  not to exceed the writebufmem limit.

  Eliminate a complete copy of the uncompressed data in the client.

  Fix a bug in the client where we would not keep our request-ahead window full.

  Fix a bug in the server where we would not merge incoming requests with
  the request currently being serviced.
	
  The above changes/bugfixes gave us about a 5% improvement in run time locally.

  Add some client/server convenience options.  For the server, -W allows 
  specification of a target bandwidth.  For the client, -C, -W and -M
  give various ways of specifying how much memory to use for net/disk
  buffering.

  Security: -S option tells client to only accept packets from a specific
  IP address.

  By default it only shows things that are over an idleness threshold. It
  also has a mode to show all expts. Also can show idleness/activity by node
  instead of by expt, which has a slightly different table. (s/Nodes/NodeID/)
  
  idlemail isn't finished yet, but I don't want it to hold up idletimes and
  the other changes any longer. It doesn't get used by anything yet, of
  course.

  time they log in, but I figured people would scream.

  Log:
  Massive reworking of our structure for defs files.
  
  Before:
  The main defs file (ie for configure) had an entry for WWWDEFS that
  pointed to a <@WWWDEFS@>-defs.php3 file in the www/ directory. The www
  defs file loaded some values about web pages, URLs, and some web
  configuration parameters.
  
  Problem:
  Anything that was only in the www defs file was not accessible in the rest
  of the universe (ie perl, C, and any other non-web-page scripts). For
  instance, you couldn't have a perl script send an email to a user with a
  link to the web site.
  
  Solution:
  Nuke all the www-defs files, move any important values into the main
  configure, and change the web defs infrastructure to respect that. This
  also meant adding about 3 lines each to all of the configure defs files.
  (There really are about 10 new values you can change in your defs file,
  but in almost all cases, the default values are the right thing.)
  
  Upgrading:
  External sites will need to move a few variables from their www-defs file
  into their configure defs file. The example file should make it pretty
  obvious. They may also want to customize some of the other vars that are
  mentioned in configure.in and www/defs.php3.in .

  Add a bit of referrer magic to login page. When clicked from the join
  or new project pages, tell login page to pass along the referrer page
  so that when login is complete, user is zapped back to the original
  page. This is especially nice when combined with the above change to
  joinproject, whereby we send along the target pid/gid, but the user
  has not yet logged in and remembers to do so via the link at the top
  of the page.
