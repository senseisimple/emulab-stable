##### Setting up nodes for use in the testbed
#####

This file explains how to get nodes set up and added to the testbed.

##### BIOS setup on the nodes

First, we need to get some things set up in the nodes' BIOS. For now, just do
this on one of the nodes, you'll do the rest later.

Booting from PXE -
The first thing we'll need to do is have the node boot from PXE on its control
network interface. This is how the testbed exercises control over what the
node will boot. In most BIOSes, this should be as simple as finding the boot
order options, and putting PXE on the top. Things can get a bit confusing if
you have more than one PXE-capable interface, because the BIOS often provides
no way of distinguishing between them - you'll have to do some trial-and error
to figure out which is which.

Disable PXE on experimental interfaces -
Nodes will boot much quicker if you disable PXE booting (through whatever means
provided by your card) on experimental net interfaces.

Set power-loss behavior -
Many BIOSes have an option about what to do after a power failure (which is
what it looks like to the node when it gets power cycled by a power
controller.)  They're usually 'always off', 'always on', and 'last state'.
Always on is the best - last state is OK, but if someone does a 'shutdown -h'
on the node, you can't bring it back up with power cycling - you have to go
punch the power button.  Just make sure they're not set to always off.          

#### Type information for the nodes

Unless you're adding some more nodes, identical to the ones you already have,
you'll need to put some type information about them into the database. You can
do this through the web interface: log in and go into admin mode. Now, click on
the 'Node Status' link on the menu, and use the 'Create a new type' link. The
important things on this page to fill out are: (You can leave the defaults for
the rest)

* Type - We typically name types 'pcXXX', where XXX is a short (a few
	characters) string describing the nodes (such as processor
	speed, chipset, etc.) eg. pc600 for 600-MHz nodes
  
* Processor -  Class of processor (eg. 'Pentium IV')

* Speed - CPU speed in MHz (eg. 3000)

* RAM - Amount of RAM in MB (eg. 256)

* HD - Hard disk size in GB (eg. 20)

* Max Interfaces - Maximum number of NIC ports (eg. dual port cards
	count as 2)
		   
* Control Network - Interface number (described below) of the control network
	interface.

* Control Network Iface - Name of the control network interface under Linux -
	usually, just a concatenation of 'eth' and the Control Network number
	you entered above. (eg. 'eth0')

* OSIDs - If Utah has already given you disk images (and their
	associated database state), then select those at this stage. You
	should have only one choice for the ImageID. For the Default OSID,
	select either Linux or FreeBSD, depending on what you think your
	users are likely to want by default.  For the time being, both the
	delay and jail OSIDs need to be FreeBSD.  If Utah has not given you
	images yet, come back and set the OSIDs once they have.
	
* Delay Capacity - How many delay nodes this node can be. For example,
	nodes with 2 experimental interfaces can be 1 delay node, nodes
	with 4 experimental interfaces can be 2 delay nodes, etc. If your
	nodes are not especially "beefy" then you might not want to set
	this number to the maximum it could be.
	
* Disk Type - FreeBSD-style disk name for the primary hard drive.
	Choices are 'ad' (IDE), 'sd' (SCSI), or 'ar' (IDE RAID).

You'll also need to add entries to the interface_types table (using the web
SQL editor, or SQL directly) for each type of network card you are using.
Notes on the columns:

* type - Name of the FreeBSD driver for the card (common ones are 'fxp' for
	Intel EtherExpress Pro 100, 'em' for Intel Pro 1000, and 'bge' for
	Broadcom gigabit).
	
* max_speed - The maximum speed of the interface, in Kbps.  Likely to be
	either 100000 for 100Mb or 1000000 for Gb.

* full_duplex - 1 if the card can operate in full duplex, 0 otherwise.

Note that you should only specify 1000000 (Gb) for the max_speed if the
card is Gb capable *and* connected to a Gigabit switch.  If a Gb capable
card is going to run at 100000 (100Mb) instead, then it is best to add
a seperate type such as 'em100' (for the 'em' type) to describe that
configuration.  This way, if you use a Gb switch in the future, you can
change the type fields in the interfaces table to be 'em' instead of 'em100'.

As an example, to insert an entry for an "fxp" interface:

	insert into interface_types set
	    type='fxp',max_speed=100000,full_duplex=1,
	    manufacturuer='Intel',model='EtherExpress Pro',ports=1,
	    connector='RJ45';

Once you have all of the interfaces specified, you need to insert the
following interface_capabilities table entries, *for each* new interface
type you entered above:

	insert into interface_capabilities set
	    type='fxp',capkey='protocols',capval='ethernet';
	insert into interface_capabilities set
	    type='fxp',capkey='ethernet_defspeed',capval='100000';

Again, if the interface is Gigabit capable and connected to a Gb switch,
capval above should be 1000000.  For example:

	insert into interface_capabilities set
	    type='em',capkey='protocols',capval='ethernet';
	insert into interface_capabilities set
	    type='em',capkey='ethernet_defspeed',capval='1000000';

In such a configuration, you will also want to add:

	insert into interface_capabilities set
	    type='em',capkey='ethernet_auxspeeds',capval='100000';

This allows a Gb 'em' interface to be configured in an experiment as 100Mb
without the use of a delay node; i.e., by setting the switch and interface
characteristics to 100Mb directly.  In theory you could use this to
configure 10Mb links without a delay node as well, but in our experience,
we have had too many problems getting switch and node to communicate when
hardwiring at 10Mb.  So we just use delay nodes to handle 10Mb.


##### Bringing up the first node

We'll start by bringing up the first node in the testbed, to make sure things
are working, and so that you can set some initial values. If we haven't already
given it to you, ask Utah for the 'newnode' MFS.

What's going to happen as we bring nodes up is that they should boot into
the 'newnode' MFS, which is a stripped down version of FreeBSD that runs
out of a memory filesystem. This MFS reports in to boss, informing it of
it's existence and key things such as it's MAC addresses. Do the BIOS setup
detailed above on this node, and fire it up.  By the time it's got a
FreeBSD login prompt on the console, it should have reported in. This will
send mail to the local testbed-ops list.

Now, let's take a look at the web page where nodes that have checked in, and
are awaiting creation as 'real' nodes, show up. Log into the web interface as
an admin (make sure to go 'red dot'). Now, go to the 'Add Testbed Nodes' link.
Clicking on the numeric ID next to a node will bring up a page with more
information about the node, which you can edit. You can select nodes with the
checkboxes along the left side - actions taken by the buttons below operate on
the selected nodes.

WARNING: Nothing on this page asks for confirmation, so be careful where you
click.

On this page, you should now see the first node you booted up, which should
have gotten the name 'pc1'. Click on the ID number (which is probably '1') to
see more detail. Make sure that the number of interfaces reported is correct.
Note that the 'Temporary IP' shown on this page is the dynamic one assigned to
the node by DHCP, from the dynamic range you set up in the defs file. If
you need to SSH into to it to check things out, until it's be really added
to the testbed, use this IP.

Next, make sure that the 'Type' column is filled in with the one you entered
into the types table earlier. If it isn't, fix that now using the 'Set Type'
box.

Next, set the node name to your preferred naming scheme. We strongly suggest
leaving it as-is (ie. using pcXXX to name the nodes), but if you must change
it, do so now - nodes you add later will get a name based on this one, with the
number and the end incremented. The code that does this guessing supports node
naming schemes that end in numbers, or end with '-a'.

Now, you'll need to set the IP address for this node. Subsequent nodes will
have their IP addresses computed from this one. (ie. if you set pc1 to an
address that ends in '.1', pc3 will get address '.3').

The other thing to check here is to see what order the interface got detected
in. Unfortunately, FreeBSD and Linux sometimes detect them in different orders.
If you will usually be running Linux on the nodes, you probably want to
re-order them to the Linux order so that the database state will make more
sense to you. At this point, figure out the mapping from the FreeBSD order to
the Linux one, and write that down. (If necessary, you could boot the node up
from Knoppix, or some distribution's install floppy/CD to determine the Linux
order - use MAC addresses to map this to the FreeBSD one.)

If you somehow make a mistake and need to delete a node that's been created,
use the 'deletenode' script on boss. For example, to delete pc1 from the DB:

	withadminprivs /usr/testbed/sbin/deletenode pc1

##### Bringing up the rest of the nodes

Okay, now that you've got the first node up, the rest should be easy. Bring the
second node (pc2) up, just like you did the first one. Check to make sure that
it got an appropriate name and IP address, extrapolated from the first one. If
that works, start bringing the others up in order. It's important to do them in
order, because identifying which is which if you do them out of order can be
very painful! If there are some nodes you simply can't bring up, because of bad
hardware, etc. write these down, and we'll fix things up later.

Important note: Remember the size of the dynamic range you picked for dhcp
in the defs file? Well, that will limit how many of nodes you can
bring up at a time.  If you run out of IP addresses, continue on with the
nodes you have up, and repeat these steps later with the remainder.

Okay, got all the nodes up? Good. At this point, you can fix things up for any
you had to skip, using the 'Add to Node ID suffix' box. If, for example, you
couldn't boot pc10 select all the nodes detected as pc10 and higher, and add 1
to their node numbers. You will then want to use the 'Recalculate IPs' button
on these nodes to get their IP addresses set appropriately.

The type for each node is supposed to get detected automatically, but this can
be a bit imprecise (ie. processor speeds are never exactly as advertised - a
2GHz processor may be 1.99 GHz.) So, if the nodes didn't get their types
detected correctly, just select them all, and use the 'set type' button.

##### Figuring out interfaces

If you found earlier that the FreeBSD and Linux ordering for interfaces was
different, we'll fix that up now.  Use the boxes right above the 'Re-number
interfaces' button to do this. Just leave blank any interface numbers your
nodes don't have. For example, if you have two interfaces, and what FreeBSD
detects as eth0 is eth1 under Linux, and vice versa for eth1, you'd enter
'1' and '0' in the first two boxes. Select all nodes, and hit the
're-number' button. Once you've got this sorted out, the 'Control MAC'
column should be correct.

Now, we're going to figure out where the interfaces are plugged into your
switches - you should have entered your switches into the database as part of
setup-db.txt . If they're not already, enable all of the ports on your
experimental network that have experimental interfaces connected to them. Also,
in order to work around some strange behavior (possibly a bug?), you'll need
to place these ports in some VLAN other than VLAN #1. If you just now
enabled these interfaces, wait a few minutes to give the switches time to learn
the nodes' MAC addresses. Now, select all the nodes, and click the 'search
switch ports' button. This will grab the MAC tables from all switches you put
into the database, which we'll match up with the MACs that the nodes themselves
reported. This will take a little while, and it will report any interfaces it
failed to find. Note - if you didn't enter your control network switch into the
database, this is okay, but this step won't find any control network
interfaces. That's acceptable. But, make sure it doesn't complain about any
experimental-network interfaces.

##### Creating the nodes

You're finally ready to take these nodes and actually create them! (By this
point, you should have a disk image, etc. from Utah.) Select all the nodes, hit
'Create', and wait a while. This enter all of the nodes into their permanent
location in the database, and will reboot them into a 'full' FreeBSD MFS. It
also puts them into the emulab-ops/hwdown experiment, to make sure that no
experimenters get them in case something went wrong. Inspect a few to make sure
they booted right. If so, free them from the hwdown experiment with:
nfree emulab-ops hwdown pc1 pc2 pc3 ...

At this point, they should get a disk image loaded and end up in the free pool.

##### Serial lines and power controllers

This node creation process doesn't handle serial lines and power controllers
yet, unfortunately. These will need entries added to the tiplines and outlets
tables, respectively. Contact Utah if you need help with this.
