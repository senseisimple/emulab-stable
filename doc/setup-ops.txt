##### Setting up the Utah Network Testbed software
##### Tested on FreeBSD 4.3, FreeBSD 4.5, FreeBSD 4.6, and FreeBSD 4.7
#####

##### Step 0 - OS installation and setup

Install FreeBSD on the machine you'll be using for your ops node, using the
standard FreeBSD installation process. You don't need to worry about which ports
to install, etc., as the ones required by this software will be installed
automatically. You do, however, need to partition your filesystems so that you
have the proper amount of space for certain directories - see below for
details.

Make sure that you have the network correctly configured.

The following directories will need to exist on partitions that have enough
space to hold them:

/usr/testbed/ - Needs space for testbed software and logs. A few gigs should be
			plenty.
/users/       - Needs space for user home directories. Amount of space required 
			depends on how many users you expect to have.
			Generally, though, we suggest that users store large
			files related to their projects in the /proj directory.
/proj/        - Needs space for project files. We recommend that this be larger
			than /users, to encourage people to store files here,
			which aids per-project accountability.
/groups/      - Needs enough space for files shared by the sub-groups of
			projects. These are primarily used by classes, if any.
/share/       - Exported read-only to all nodes, we use it for providing the
			source for the FreeBSD and Linux versions we run to
			experimenters.
			
You may want to enforce quotas on the user-writable filesystems.

Make sure that, no matter how you decide to partition things up, you make
symlinks to the appropriate places. ie., if you make one big filesystem called
/z that has /users, /proj, and /groups in it, make sure you:
ln -s /z/users /users
ln -s /z/proj /proj
... etc.

It's simplest if you don't create any users yet, and just log in a root for the
time being. Our software will create users later, once you get boss set up.

##### Step 1 - Unpacking and running configure

At this point, you'll need to make a 'defs' file - see setup.txt for
instructions for doing so. You'll use the same defs file on boss and ops.

Unpack the testbed source, and run it's configure script. Use the --with-TBDEFS
option to configure to give it the path to your defs file.

For example, I have the testbed source in ~/testbed, my defs file in
/users/ricci/testbed/defs-ricci, and use the ~/tbobj directory to do my builds
in:
cd ~/tbobj
~/testbed/configure --with-TBDEFS=/users/ricci/testbed/defs-ricci

##### Step 2 - Running the ops installation script

This part is brand-new, so please report any problems with it.

In the object tree you've configured (in my example above, ~/tbobj), there's an
'install' subdirectory, with a script called 'ops-install'. Just run this
script as root. It will take care of installing ports, and doing various other
configuration of FreeBSD required to make it into an ops node. The script is
designed so that you can run it as many times as you want, and it'll just skip
stuff it's already done. If it fails, send the output to Utah so that we can
fix it up. If it succeeds, follow any other instructions it may have, then
reboot the machine.

(You may have to set the executable bit on this script, since configure won't -
I'd like to get this solved at some point.)

You should be aware that, among other things, this script sets up sendmail, and
sets up password-less 'sudo' for anyone in the 'wheel' group. If you don't want
these for security reasons, you can undo them after the installation script is
finished.

##### Step 3 - Installing from source

To install the actual testbed software, simply do a 'gmake ops-install' in your
object directory.

##### Step 4 - Setting up mailing lists

Optional. The ops-install script set up some mailing lists for the email
addresses you set up in the defs file, in /etc/mail/lists . If you want to run
these mailing lists off your ops node, you can put some people in them now.
These are just standard sendmail list files - a list of addresses and/or
archive files, one per line.
