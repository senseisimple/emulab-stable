##### Setting up tbdb for a new boss node
#####

Note: we are working on better automating many of the procedures in this
document - for now, though, a few of them are still manual.

Note: steps labeled "Local Only" are only required when setting up a testbed
with local nodes - they can be skipped in a widearea-only testbed.

##### Step 1 - Setup users, projects, and experiments

In order to proceed, you should have the following working (from the boss and
ops setup documentation):

   NFS mounts between boss and ops
   Root ssh keys (so that root on boss can ssh to ops without a password)
   The web interface

Make sure you can log into the web interface using the 'elabman' account.
The password for the elabman account is the same as the root password on
your boss node (see, we told you to remember it!).

This account is created as a testbed administrator, but there is one thing
you will need to do in order to use your admin powers. For the same reason
that you use 'su' and/or 'sudo' on your UNIX boxes instead of logging in as
root, you must explicitly enable admin privileges after you log in. When
logged in as a user who is allowed to become an admin, you will see a green
dot on the left side of the header above the main page content. The green
dot means that although you are allowed admin powers, they are currently
turned off, and you see the same web pages that a regular user sees, and
can use the same actions. If you click on the dot, it will turn red, and you
will have full administrator privileges; we call this 'going red dot'.
If you click on the dot again, it will go back to green, thus you can
easily flip back and forth between normal privs and admin privs. Note
that most of the procedures in this file require you to be in red dot mode.

Now, we will use the elabman user to bootstrap your first real account and
project. Note that while you will use the elabman account to do this, the
elabman account should not be considered a real account; it is intended to
help bootstrap only and as such, does not have the power to perform many
actions that are required later (such as adding nodes to the testbed).

Login as user 'elabman' if you have not already done so. Go into 'red dot'
mode by clicking on the green dot. You should see the "Start a New Testbed
Project" page, with a "Create First Project" link on the left menu under
"Experimentation".

Fill in your own information in the 'Project Head Information'
section.  It is important that you provide a working email address! Select
your initial Project Name in the 'Project Information' section (we call
ours 'testbed', but you can call yours whatever you call your project or
research group).  Also specify a *working* URL (it is required) for the
project. Submit the form using the Submit button at the bottom of the page.

The web interface will grind along for a minute or so. DO NOT CLICK THE
STOP BUTTON! When it is done, you will see a message that invites you to
login as the user you just created. Do this now so that you can continue
with setting up your testbed. Note that the elabman account has been
deactivated during this process to avoid problems later on (and potential
security breaches). 

Before we continue, lets explain a few more important items:

* Project Membership: In addition to the project you just created, you have
  automatically been added to the "emulab-ops" project with trust value
  "group_root". This allows you to approve new members to that project as
  well as your own project.

* Admin Mode: Your new account has been given "administrator" mode, as
  described above. To change that value for other users after their
  accounts are created, you can do this on boss:

	echo 'update users set admin=1 where uid="<username>"' | mysql tbdb

* Shell on Boss: Give yourself the special ability to login to boss;
  in contrast, most (normal) users have a restricted shell on boss,
  and are not allowed to log in using a password. Login to boss as root,
  and edit the password file using the 'vipw' command (FreeBSD requires
  some special processing on the password file after editing, which vipw
  does.). Give yourself a real shell (say, /bin/csh) and then exit the
  editor. Then give yourself a password (in general, it is safer to have a
  different password on boss then on ops!). Use this command:

	passwd <your username>

  NOTE: See doc/shelloboss.txt for important security issues w.r.t. giving
  real shells on boss. Before you give a real shell to someone, it is a
  good idea for them to read this file!

* Now logout and back in as yourself. In general, it is safer and better to
  not do things as root. In fact, many testbed programs will complain if
  you invoke them as root because it makes accounting and auditing more
  difficult.

* Unix Group Membership: The Emulab account system manages both the
  password file and the group file (/etc/group) on both boss and ops. If
  you edit them directly, those changes will likely be lost. If you want to be
  a member of any UNIX groups on boss, use our 'unixgroups' command. For
  example, to add yourself to the "operator" group, do this on boss (as
  yourself, not root):

	withadminprivs unixgroups -a <username> operator

  NOTE: Your initial account created above was already placed in the wheel
  and tbadmin groups.

  NOTE: Just as you need to go 'red dot' to use admin privileges on the web
  interface, you must also explicitly enable them on the command line. To
  do this, prefix the command you want to run with 'withadminprivs',
  which can be abbreviated as 'wap'.

* Set your path: withadminprivs and many other admin-type commands live in
  /usr/testbed/sbin - you'll want to put this and /usr/testbed/bin in your
  $PATH.

Others at your site can now apply to join your project, or start their own.

##### Step "-1" - Undoing Step 1 if necessary

If something went wrong during Step 1, it can leave things in an inconsistent
state.  Here's how to undo it without starting over from scratch.  The goal is
to remove things that boss-install checks on, so it can be run again to put
the Emulab database and directories into initial conditions.

 * Remove users, groups, and directories set up by boss-install.
     pw userdel -n elabman -r
     pw userdel -n elabckup -r
     ssh -n ops pw userdel -n elabman -r
     ssh -n ops pw userdel -n elabckup -r

     ls -l /users /proj /groups
     rm -r /proj/* /groups/*
     mkdir /proj/cvsrepos
     pw groupdel -n emulab-ops
     ls -l /usr/testbed/{expwork,*/proj}
     rm -r /usr/testbed/expwork/* /usr/testbed/*/proj/*
     ls -l /usr/testbed/{expwork,*/proj}

 * Remove user and group from the elabman "Create First Project" pages.
     set me = *your-login*
     set us = testbed
     pw userdel -n $me -r
     pw groupdel -n $us
     ls -l /users /proj /groups

 * Also remove any other users and groups you've created since then.
   Otherwise you will get this message until you've cleared them:
   'Error Creating Project: Transient error; please try again later.'
     tail /etc/passwd
     tail /etc/group
     set him = *user*
     set them = *group*
     pw userdel -n $him -r
     pw groupdel -n $them

 * Kill the database.
     mysql -e "drop database tbdb"

 * Run boss-install, checking particularly on the success of these tasks:
   . Setting up database
   . Setting up initial user (elabman)
   . Setting up checkup user (elabckup)
   . Setting up system experiments

Now you can go back to Step 1 with the first login as 'elabman' and try again.

##### Step 2 - Setup web sql editor

Several of the steps below require you to add data to the database by hand. If
you're comfortable with SQL, you can do this directly with SQL queries, or you
can use the generic web-based SQL table editor provided with the testbed
software. If you plan to use the former method, you can skip this step.

********************************** WARNING **********************************
* Many tables depend on data in other tables, or depend on programs running *
* to effect a change. Thus, you should not edit tables other than the ones  *
* described in this document.                                               *
* You have been warned......                                                *
********************************** WARNING **********************************

First, you'll want to protect the webdb script from outside browsers. Because
of its flexibility, it would be quite dangerous if it were broken into. So, we
add an additional layer of protection by limiting the IP addresses it may be
used from. Open your httpd.conf file (located in /usr/local/etc/apache)
and find the 'Directory' directives. Add a section such as this:

	<Directory /usr/testbed/www/webdb>
		AllowOverride None
		order deny,allow
		deny from all
		allow from 155.99.212.
	</Directory>
	
If you installed the testbed tree somewhere other than /usr/testbed, fix the
directory. Change the 'allow from' line to match your IP subnet (note the '.'
on the end of the address, to match the entire subnet). You can have as
many 'allow' lines as you want. Restart apache:

	sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache.sh stop
	sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache.sh start

Next, you'll need to specify which users have the ability to edit the database.
This is done with the 'dbedit' column in the users table. You can turn on
a user's dbedit bit like so:

	echo 'update users set dbedit=1 where uid="<username>"' | mysql tbdb

##### Step 3 - Setup switches
##### Local Only

1) Create node types for switches

Add entries to the node_types table for each type of switch you'll be
using. You can do this by talking to mysql directly, but is more easily
accomplished using the web interface. In 'red dot' mode, go to:

	https://<yourbossnode>/editnodetype.php3?new_type=1

These are the switch types currently supported:
    cisco{65xx,40xx,45xx,29xx,55xx}
        For example, if you had a 6509, you'd enter 'cisco6509'
        If your switch runs IOS (instead of CatOS), append '-ios' to the
        type.
    intel
        The supported type is the 510T (but just put 'intel' in the type field)
    nortel1100, nortel5510
    foundry1500, foundry9604
(Note: Case sensitive!)

Set the "class" to 'switch' and set "processor" to whatever you used for the
"type" field.

Most of the other columns are not important for switches (so you can set
them to 0), but putting in "Max Interfaces" (if the switch is expandable)
can be useful for your own information.


2a) Create interface types for switch interconnects (if any)

If you'll be connecting the experimental switches together, you'll add
interface types for the ports you'll be using to link them together.  These go
into the interface_types table. Make up something descriptive for the 'type'
column (no spaces). Make sure to set the max_speed (in Kbps) and full_duplex
(1 for full duplex, 0 for half duplex) columns correctly. As an example:

	insert into interface_types set
	    type='cisco_gigE',max_speed=1000000,full_duplex=1,
	    manufacturuer='Cisco',model='WS-X6316-GE-TX',ports=16,
	    connector='RJ45';


2b) Create interface capabilities entries for switch interconnects (if any)
    
If you added any entries to interface_types in the previous step, you also
need to add entries to the interface_capabilities table. Using the same
type name you used above, add a capkey for "protocols", usually set to
"ethernet" and another capkey for "ethernet_defspeed" to the same value you
used in the interface_types table. Do this for each type you entered in
step 2a above. For example:

	insert into interface_capabilities set
	    type='cisco_gigE',capkey='protocols',capval='ethernet';
	insert into interface_capabilities set
	    type='cisco_gigE',capkey='ethernet_defspeed',capval='1000000';

3) Create switches in nodes table

Next, add the switches to the nodes table. The only necessary fields here are
node_id (choose one appropriate to the switch), type (use one of the ones you
created earlier,) and role. Role, for switches, should be either 'testswitch'
or 'controlswitch', depending on whether you're using it for the experimental
or control network. If it's used for both, call it a 'testswitch'. Example:

	insert into nodes set
	    node_id='cisco1',phys_nodeid='cisco1',
	    type='cisco6509',role='testswitch';

The node_id you select must resolve in DNS and/or boss's /etc/host file - we'll
use this name to contact the switch for SNMP. Ie., you must be able to ping the
name you select as the switch's node_id. 

4) Add state for switch interconnects

If you'll be connecting the experimental switches together, add interfaces to
each of them.  Use the interface types you created above for them, and be sure
to get the correct card and port numbers. In modular switches, such as the
Cisco Cat6500 series, use the switch's 'native' module and port numbers.  For
switches that do not have expansion modules, the card number is assumed to be
0. Make sure to get the current_speed (this time, in Mbps, and note, this is
an enumerated type, not an integer, so you need to put quotes around the
speed) and duplex correct. You'll also need to set 'iface' to some string
representing the port - I tend to use 'module/port' (ie. '1/1').

Now, go into the wires table and add wires connecting the switch interfaces you
just created. Make sure to set the type to 'Trunk'. In this case, it doesn't
matter which switch you use as node 1 (the node_id1, card1, port1 columns), and
which you use as node 2. If you have a non-modular switch, all ports are
considered to be on card 0.

7) Create switch stacks

Into the switch_stack_types table, create entries for each stack in your
network. A stack is set of switches that share common VLANs. Usually, your
experimental switches will be one stack, and the control network another. You
should create a stack even if there is only one switch in it. The control
stack should be named 'Control', and the experimental stack 'Experiment' (make
sure to get the capitalization right). The 'leader' field should be set to the
node_id of the master switch in the stack.  The stack_type column is used by
snmpit to determine which module to use to talk to the stack. Most sites
should set the stack type to 'generic', which handles all switch types
currently supported by Emulab. If you have all Cisco switches, and are having
problems with the 'generic' stack type, you can try setting the type to
'cisco'.  Making a stack for the control network is optional, but will enable
control-net firewalls. There are a few columns in this table that you will need
to set:

supports_private: (Cisco only) This switch can make private VLANs - probably
    best to leave it as 0
single_domain: (Cisco only) Means that all switches in the stack use VTP to
    maintain a common set of VLANs. This means that we will only create VLANs
    on the stack leader - if set to 0, we create VLANs on each switch
    individually
snmp_community: The SNMP community string we use for read-write access to the
    switch. Most switches use 'private' by default.
min_vlan: The smallest VLAN number that the testbed software will use. If left
    NULL, defaults to 2.
max_vlan: Ditto, but the biggest number. Defaults to 1000.

Finally, add switches to these stacks by putting entries in the switch_stacks
table, listing the node_id of each switch and the stack_id of the stack it
belongs to. You can leave the 'is_primary' column of these rows with its default
value (1).

After getting this set up, run 'wap snmpit -l', and make sure it doesn't give
you any error messages. If it tells you that your type of device isn't
supported, ask Utah - we have a list of supported devices in snmpit, but they
are just the ones we've tested. Hopefully, yours will work too, we just haven't
tried it.

Your snmpit output should look something like this:

%wap snmpit -l
VLAN     Project/Experiment VName     Members
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Control-                              myswitch:1

Note that 'Control-' is a truncated version of the name 'Control-hardware' that
you created in setup-network.txt . If you see any other VLANs on this list,
that's not a problem, but if you want to delete any of them, you can do that
with 'wap snmpit -o <name>'.

##### Step 4 - Setup control hardware
##### Local Only

1) Power controllers

The only two supported power controllers at this time are the APC AP9210 and
the BayTech RPC27. Theoretically, other SNMP and serial-controlled power
controllers should not be hard to support.

If your power controllers are controlled via IP and SNMP, add a node type andor
interface type for them. Then, give them an entries in the nodes, interfaces,
and wires tables. Make sure to get the IP address correct in the interfaces
table. The role listed in the nodes table should be 'powerctrl'.

If you have serial power controllers, just create entries node_types and nodes
- no interfaces or wires. Again, the role in the nodes table should be
'powerctrl'.

##### Step 5 - Images and OSids

These will depend on the image(s) and any OSKit kernels you've recieved, or
built yourself. Since you're probably using disk images from Utah, the best
thing to do is ask us for the appropriate lines for the os_info and images
tables. Make sure to get the PXEBOOT, PXEFRISBEE, and PXEFBSD OSIDs, which are
required to load disk images.  For a widearea-only testbed, no images entries
in the images table a required, but OSIDs are still useful, to determine what a
node's capabilities are. 

##### Step 6 - Setup nodes

To add nodes to the testbed, see setup-nodes.txt .
