1. DESCRIPTION:

These are the files/directories needed for PXE booting.


2. CONTENTS:

README
	This file

freebsd*/
	kernel/MFS for a PXE-booted memory based FreeBSD 4.7 or 6.2 system.
	We use this MFS for creating disk images and general maintenance
	tasks on a node (e.g., when the node's disk is scrogged).
	The MFS contains a pretty small set of utilities.

frisbee*/
	kernel/MFS for a PXE-booted memory based FreeBSD 4.7 or 6.2 system.
	This MFS is considerably smaller than the "freebsd" one.
	It is used to reload node disks with frisbee.  Since it may be loaded
	simultaneously by many nodes to reload their disks, we wanted
	this to be as small as possible.  Not intended as an interactive
	environment, its rc.local script invokes frisbee and then reboots.

freebsd.newnode*/
	kernel/MFS for a PXE-booted memory based FreeBSD 4.7 or 6.2 system.
	A specialized version of the freebsd MFS for loading on nodes
	which are not yet part of Emulab.  Has a generic kernel and specialized
	scripts for figuring out the network connections, etc.

mfs-entries.sql
	At some point in the Emulab setup directions you will be told that
	you need to ask Utah about DB entries for the MFSes.  This file
	contains commands for setting up those entries.  As the database
	schema changes occasionally, you should check the table layout
	at the beginning of the file to make sure it matches your DB before
	performing the INSERT commands.

pxeboot*/pxeboot.emu-{sio,vga,null}
	This is a specialized version of the FreeBSD boot loader.
	There is a version for use with the 4.7 based system (pxeboot47)
	and one for the FreeBSD 6.2 system (pxeboot62).  In each of these
	directories, there are three versions of the boot loader:
	serial-line (-sio), VGA (-vga), and null (-null) console versions
	of our standard PXE-booted startup.  Whichever you choose should
	be renamed as /tftpboot/pxeboot.emu (or whatever your boss dhcpd.conf
	file says).


3. INSTALLATION:

If you are reading this file, then I guess you have succeeded in unpacking
the tarball.  Hopefully, you have unpacked it into /tftpboot.  If not, go
do that now, I'll wait...

...ok.  First, you have to choose between using FreeBSD 4.7 or FreeBSD 6.2
MFSes.  You almost certainly want to use the 6.2 versions since 6.2 supports
more hardware.  If you have any problems with those, then try the 4.7 versions.
In summary, I recommend:

	pxeboot62/pxeboot.emu-{sio,vga} (pick one and rename to "pxeboot.emu")
	frisbee62 (rename to "frisbee")
	freebsd62 (rename to "freebsd")
	freebsd62.newnode (rename to "freebsd.newnode")

Anyway, after choosing your MFSes, you should have three generic MFSes
(frisbee, freebsd, freebsd.newnode).  The three MFSes unloaded are "generic"
in the sense that they don't have any of your (or our) Emulab keys or
passwords.  That is ok for the "newnode" MFS, but the other two will need
to be customized for your site.  See the README file in each boot
subdirectory for MFS-specific customization and installation instructions.

If you don't have VGA or serial lines, and it appears that nodes are not
booting, try using pxeboot.emu-null which gives you a non-interactive version
of the boot loader.  Some sites have had problems with "phantom" serial line
input from a non-existent serial line causing the -sio version of the boot
loader to drop into interactive mode.  Make sure you replace the loader.conf
file in the three subdirectories with the -null version as well.
