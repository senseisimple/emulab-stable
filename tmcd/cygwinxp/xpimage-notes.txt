# Blow-by-blow directions for setting up an XP image from scratch.
# 
# These are raw notes and commands to paste into a shell.
# Mostly Bash shell commands for Windows, some tcsh commands for Boss or Ops.
# Some (most?) of it could be scriptified with some work. 
# 
# A major prerequisite is a Windows XP image that doesn't require activation on each
# installation.  We use the MSDN August, 2001 image, updated by Service Packs and
# Windows Update.  "Bulk license" versions should work as well.

# Notice that this file has spaces instead of tabs at the beginning of lines.  A tab
# in either Bash or tcsh causes it to display all of the possible command completions!

# Here's a little Emacs keyboard macro to ease the copy-and-paste business:
    ; Copy a command line, leaving off the whitespace on the beginning of the line.
    (fset 'copy-command-line [?\M-m ?\C-  ?\C-e ?\C-f C-insert])
    (global-set-key "\^C\^E" 'copy-command-line)

  # By convention, optional "informational" commands are indented a couple of spaces more.
  ## Debugging and problem-solving stuff is double-# commented.

# TCSH aliases used below:
alias v 'ls -lsF'               # "Verbose" listing
setenv en emulab.net
alias rootpc 'sudo ssh pc\!^.$en \!:2*'
alias rootrd 'rdesktop -K -g 1280x1024 -a 16 -u root pc\!^.$en &'

# In Bash,
alias v='ls -lsF'

# To make UNC paths like //fs work in Cygwin below, either:
# . Explore to \\fs\share, giving *your* login name and Windows password,
# . or use the "net use" command to provide it.
  net use Z: '\\fs\share' 'mypwd' /user:mylogin /persistent:no

================================================================
    . Start with a clean XP image, as it comes from the CD.

      - How to do the Windows XP installation and make a WINXP-BASE image:

        . Swap in a firewalled experiment with a FBSD-STD image.

            # Firewall while making Windows images.
            set fw [new Firewall $ns]
            $fw set-type ipfw2-vlan
            $fw set-style basic

        . Do "node_admin on" so PXE throws it into the FBSD MFS.
        . Hook up a console, reboot and modify the boot order to boot from the Windows XP CD.

        . Do the Windows installation, adding whatever drivers are needed.
          - 8 gig is a good size for the XP NTFS partition, of which 4-5 will be user space.
            (They can always allocate more later with Disk Manager.)
          - You'll save some work later if you make the first admin user account named "root".

        . Set the usual password for root in Control Panel / User Accounts.
            It asks whether to make the root files private.  I've been saying "no".
          - While you're there, click "Change the way users log on or off" and make
            sure "Use Fast User Switching" is turned on.

        . Make sure you turn on Remote Desktop logins under Control Panel / System / Remote (!)

        . Go into Control Panel / Power Options / Hibernate, and make sure it's disabled.
          This will give you extra gigs of disk space on C: equal to your RAM size .
          Also set Power Options / Power Schemes to "Always On".

        . Set the workgroup name to EMULAB in Control Panel/System/Computer Name/Change...
          No need to reboot yet if you have more to do.

        . On reboot, restore the boot order so PXE goes back into the FBSD MFS, and make an image.
          I called mine WINXP-BASE.  (See imagezip commands below.)  
          Make sure the Operational Mode is MINIMAL in the Image Descriptor, rather than NORMALv2!

      - Make a firewalled experiment using the WINXP-BASE image above, log in as "root".

         . The experiment should be behind a firewall, to avoid contamination.

            # Firewall while making Windows images.
            set fw [new Firewall $ns]
            $fw set-type ipfw2-vlan
            $fw set-style basic

         . Note that it takes a couple of minutes after booting for the RDP service to start,
           so don't worry if you can't log in at first.

      - Set the Windows "w32time" NTP client to connect to the Emulab NTP host.
        Runs as a service, periodically contacts the time server.
          # ntp1 is a DNS alias for Ops.
          ### Do this in a Windows CMD shell, since you don't have Cygwin shells yet. ###
          net time /querysntp
          # Need to restart w32time before it sees the setsntp configuration. (?)
          net stop w32time
          net time /setsntp:ntp1
          net time /querysntp
          net start w32time
          # May take a minute to take effect.
             
      - Disable the Messenger Service to keep annoying spam pop-ups away.
            # Optional informational commands are indented...
            cygrunsrv -VQ  Messenger
          sc config Messenger start= disabled
          sc stop Messenger

      - Disable the SSDP Discovery Service and Universal Plug and Play Device Host.
        This closes port 5000 to attacks.  Also disable the Remote Registry service.
            cygrunsrv -VQ  SSDPSRV
            cygrunsrv -VQ  upnphost
            cygrunsrv -VQ  RemoteRegistry

          sc config SSDPSRV start= disabled
          sc config upnphost start= disabled
          sc config RemoteRegistry start= disabled

          sc stop SSDPSRV
          sc stop upnphost
          sc stop RemoteRegistry

      - Go into Control Panel/Administrative Tools (it's under Performance and
        Maintenance in the new Control Panel interface.)

        . Right-click Start/"Explore All Users" and drag a copy of the Computer
          Management shortcut from Administrative Tools into the All Users/Desktop
          folder.

      - If you haven't already made a "root" account, go into Computer Management/
        System Tools/Local Users and Groups/Users, put it in the Administrators group.
        . Also make it a member of the Users groups.

      - Start IE, make "blank" the home page. Click Tools/Internet Options/Home page/Use Blank.

      - Show My Computer.  (Desktop Properties/Desktop/Customize Desktop...)
        Turn off "Run Desktop Cleanup Wizard every 60 days".

      - Log in as root and create C:/Temp, C:/Software/Cygwin
          ### [Do this in a Windows cmd prompt, there's no Cygwin shell yet...] ###
          mkdir C:\Temp
          mkdir C:\Software\Cygwin

      - Install Cygwin
        . (Try copying /etc/setup/* from an existing image to script the selection work.)
           # There's no scp to copy them with, so use Windows SMB File Sharing to get it
           # from \\fs\share\windows\cygwin-etc-setup.)
             mkdir C:\cygwin
           # Hm.  Still didn't come up with the added packages selected.
           # When C:\Software\Cygwin/http... is copied, it thinks everything is already installed.
           # Removing the /etc/setup/installed.db file seems not to help.
           # Nothing relevant to install in HKLM/SOFTWARE/Cygnus Solutions/Cygwin, either...

        . Download setup from www.cygwin.com/setup.exe to C:/Software/Cygwin.
          I keep a copy cached on /share/windows.  
          When you already have a Cygwin, you can update the setup.exe by:

           # [On Ops as you.]
           set pc=297
           scp -p /share/windows/cygwin-setup.exe pc$pc":"/tmp/setup.exe
             # Update the cached copy if you downloaded a new one.
             scp -p pc$pc":"/cygdrive/c/Software/Cygwin/setup.exe /share/windows/cygwin-setup.exe

           # [On the machine as root.]
           csc=C:/Software/Cygwin
           chown -R root.None $csc
           chmod g+w $csc/setup.exe
           cp -p /tmp/setup.exe $csc
           chmod 755 $csc/setup.exe
           ls -l $csc

        . Run Cygwin setup.exe in an RDP window.  (GUI-only interface.)
            # When Cygwin is already installed, ensure that upgrading SSH won't hang.
            net stop sshd
              ps -Welf | grep 'ssh'
              killall ssh-agent

            # Ditto agetty.  The SysV init daemon keeps it running.
              ps -Welf | grep 'agetty\|init'
              cygrunsrv.exe -VQ init
            net stop init
              ps -Welf | grep 'agetty\|init'
              cygrunsrv.exe -VQ init
            mv /sbin/agetty.exe{,.save}

            C:/Software/Cygwin/setup.exe &

        . Install dir is C:\cygwin, package dir is C:\Software\Cygwin .
        . Download site mirror is http://mirrors.xmission.com .
        . Click [View] to "Not Installed" (alphabetical), or "Partial" to see an update.
        . Click on the Skip in the "New" column and change it to add a binary version of:
            [agetty and more are now in the util-linux package.]
            agetty (with src), bison, cvs, cygrunsrv, ed, file, flex, gawk, gcc,
            gdb, inetutils, make, minires-devel, more, nano, netcat, openssh (with src),
            openssl-devel, patch, perl, perl-libwin32, ping, psmisc, python, rpm, rsync, rxvt, 
            shutdown, sysvinit, tcsh, vim, wget, zip .
          Click in the "src" column for openssh and agetty, so patches can be applied.
        . Since installs hang on /sbin or /etc files, open the permissions up very temporarily.
            chmod 777 /sbin /etc
          Then click "Next" to do the installations.
            # Close up again afterward.
            chmod 755 /sbin /etc
        . At the end, don't "Create an icon on the Desktop", do "Add icon to Start Menu".
        . A Cygwin update will probably tell you to reboot to get new dll's loaded.

        . Add ;C:\cygwin\bin to the end of the System PATH in 
          Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables.

        . Start up a Cygwin shell and fix the shell properties (right-click title bar):
            Options QuickEdit Mode on, Layout/screen buffer height 3000, window height 55.
            Check OK, "Modify shortcut that started this window", OK.
          - Might as well fix the Start/Programs/Accessories/Command Prompt properties, too.
          - Create c:\cygin\cygwin-tcsh.bat as a copy of c:\cygin\cygwin.bat with
            "bash --login -i" changed to "tcsh -l".
               ### Now we can use Cygwin (Bash) shell commands... ###
               alias v='ls -lsF'
               cd C:/cygwin

               chmod +x cygwin-tcsh.bat
          - Copy the shortcuts in \\fs\share\windows\Desktop to the All Users/Desktop
            . Make sure the directory winds up with owner and group SYSTEM.SYSTEM,
              and the shortcut (.lnk) files Administrator.none .

        . Make rxvt All Users desktop icons for both Bash and TCSH.  
          It doesn't need an X server running, but uses the X mouse cut-and-paste keys.
          Windows shortcut options such as layout are ignored.  Use dash args or ~/.Xdefaults.

      . Patch agetty to support 115.2kbps serial line speed.
        agetty is now in the util-linux package (replaced by the Linux/Sun version.)
        Unfortunately, it breaks tty modes like onlcr, as well as the stty command.
        AND, it doesn't allow root logins, which makes console access kind of pointless.
        So we still need to use the old version, patched to work with 115200 bps serial.

      . Set up agetty for console logins.

        - Make sure Console Redirection is disabled after boot in the BIOS settings.

        - Turn off Windows EMS, because it disables the serial console for agetty.
          Windows "Emergency Management Services" is a second level of redirection.
          If you see the "Starting Windows" progress bar on the serial port, it's on.
          The result is that the serial port won't even show up in Device Manager.

      . Make a load average log for slothd, averaged over a 1 minute period.

        - /proc/loadavg is hard-wired to "0.00 0.00 0.00" on Cygwin now.

        - All attempts to script this setup to reproduce it on another computer have
          failed so far, including using its own "Save/Restore Settings" and
          transplanting the registry subtree.

       - Click into Computer Management / Performance Logs and Alerts / Counter Logs.
          Right-click "New Log Settings..." in the logs pane, 
            Name: "ldavg", OK.

          General tab, 
            Counters list, "Add Counters...",
              check "Use local computer counters",
              click "Add" to add % total processor (the default),
              click "Close".
            Sample data every: Interval: "60" seconds.

          Log Files tab, 
            Log file type: "Text File (Comma delimited)", 
            Uncheck "End file names with" so the result goes into ldavg.csv .

            Start Log: Click "At" (which defaults to the current time, as well as the future.) 
            Stop Log: Click "When the 1-MB log file is full.",
              When a log file closes: "Start a new log file".

          Check all three tabs, click OK.

          # ldavg should start out red (stopped) and then turn green (started) if you
          # refresh with F5.  It will start again after reboot.
          # You can turn it off and on with the right-click menu on "ldavg" in the logs pane.  
            tail -f /var/run/ldavg.csv

      . Disable TCP/IP address autoconfiguration, so unswitched interfaces like the sixth NICs
        on the pc3000's don't get Microsoft class B network 169.254 addresses assigned.

            regtool get $tcpp/IPAutoconfigurationEnabled
          regtool set -i $tcpp/IPAutoconfigurationEnabled 0

      . Reboot to make sure it all works right.  Note that prepare clears out the source
        trees, so don't do it until you've booted once and know that everything else works.
          prepare

================================================================
Making single images

    . Windows Update
      - This might be needed after each Microsoft "Patch Tuesday" (second tues of the month.)
      - After it's installed, just click Start/All Programs/Windows Update, Express, Install.
        . For initial installation, start up Internet Explorer and go to:
          http://update.microsoft.com
        . After that, Windows Update is on your Start menu.
           - The first time, just installs/updates the updater and asks to reboot.
           - I just choose the EXPRESS update, installing all high-priority updates.
           - Don't turn on Automatic Updates.

           - After rebooting, check again if there's more to install.

             To install SP2, you must have access to a console screen, because the
             Windows Firewall defaults to block both SSH and RDP.  Disable it.
             . This can be done with serial console access after the reboot with:
                   netsh firewall show config
                 netsh firewall set opmode DISABLE

             . You may need to free disk space to install SP2, or allocate a partition.
                 # The prepare script does this cleanup now.
                   v /tmp/WindowsXP-KB835935-SP2-ENU.exe
                 rm /tmp/WindowsXP-KB835935-SP2-ENU.exe
                   du -sm C:/WINDOWS/ServicePackFiles/i386
                 rm -rf C:/WINDOWS/ServicePackFiles/i386
                   du -sm C:/WINDOWS/SoftwareDistribution/Download
                 rm -rf C:/WINDOWS/SoftwareDistribution/Download/*

      - Could be a good time to update Cygwin as well.  
        . Beware of stepping on the sshd.exe and agetty.exe patches.

     . Build driver database if using sysprep.  (Only needs to be done once.)
       Set DriversPath and right-click/Install the drivers/nic .inf files
       in Windows Explorer to put them into the Drivers DB.
          regtool get /HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/DevicePath
        regtool set -s /HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/DevicePath \
                           'C:\WINDOWS\inf;C:\drivers\disk;C:\drivers\nic'
          v C:/drivers
        set sysprep=/share/windows/sysprep
        sudo scp -rp $sysprep/drivers pc$pc":"/cygdrive/c
          # You can select them all in /cygdrive/c/drivers/nic and right-click/Install once.
          # It makes corresponding PNF files in the directory and remembers DevicePath.
          e1000325.inf
          e100a325.inf
          e100b325.inf
          netag311.INF
        tail C:/WINDOWS/setupapi.log

     . Run prepare to clear out experiment-specific state.
        # Have to be on serial console to do sysprep (-s option.)
        rootpc $pc
          # Log off any non-root RDP sessions to unlock the C:/Documents and Settings files.
          qwinsta
          # Ignore complaints about all of the C:/Documents and Settings directories
          # that were never created because the users didn't log in...
          prepare -n -s

          exit

    . Add an entry at the beginning of xpimage-log.txt, and create the image
      descriptor if it's not an existing image.

    . Capture the image with imagezip.  
      You can specify the PC from which to grab the image when you create an image-id.
      Do it in red-dot mode so you can set the Reboot Waittime to 240 seconds.
      When updating existing images, I do it by hand in two stages, as below.
