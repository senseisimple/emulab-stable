# Various domain and host names
#

# Domain this testbed resides in
OURDOMAIN=example.emulab.net

# Fully-quailified hostname of the boss node
BOSSNODE=boss.example.emulab.net

# Fully-quailified hostname of the ops (also called users) node
USERNODE=ops.example.emulab.net

# Fully-quailified hostname of the fileserver (will probably be the same
# as the ops node)
FSNODE=fs.example.emulab.net

# 
# Addresses to which email will be sent - These are expected to go to mailing
# lists. You can either host the lists on your ops node, send them off to
# some external server. If you chose to run them from the ops node, the
# ops-install script sets up empty lists for you.
#

# Main address for the 'operations staff' - Copies of error messages, etc. will
# get sent to this address, and in some cases users are directed to this
# address if they have questions and/or problems.
TBOPSEMAIL=testbed-ops@example.emulab.net

# Notification of new projects requests get sent to this address for approval.
# Should have a few admin-types on it.
TBAPPROVALEMAIL=testbed-approval@example.emulab.net

# Logs, such as experiment creation/deletion go to this address. Probably no
# more than one person needs to be on this one.
TBLOGSEMAIL=testbed-logs@example.emulab.net

# Various auditing message about account maintenance go here. Again, probably
# only needs one member.
TBAUDITEMAIL=testbed-audit@example.emulab.net

# Some web reports get sent to this one.
TBWWWEMAIL=testbed-www@example.emulab.net

# Our node state management daemon sends mail to this address. Someone should
# be on this list, and reporting persistent error messages to Utah would be a
# good idea.
TBSTATEDEMAIL=testbed-stated@example.emulab.net

# We have a test suite to test the front end. This email is for the results
# of the testsuite, but is not used yet.
TBTESTSUITEEMAIL=testbed-testsuite@example.emulab.net

# We dynamically create two email addresses for notifications to users - one
# for all testbed users, and one for all users whose projects have active
# experiments. These addresses are included in the above lists, with the
# intent that they can be used to archive all mail sent to them.
