# Start up capture processes.
#
# XXX if you notice that each capture is being started up twice on reboot.
# then you need to make sure that the "local_startup" path in /etc/rc.conf
# (or /etc/defaults/rc.conf) does not include /usr/X11R6/etc/rc.d.
# In FreeBSD 6 and above, /usr/X11R6 is a symlink to /usr/local and the
# result is that scripts in /usr/local/etc/rc.d wind up being called twice.
# This is okay for scripts that fully use the FreeBSD rc system, but since
# this script is "not quite conforming" it causes captures to be started
# twice. You may need to override local_startup in /etc/rc.conf to avoid this.

# run_capture contains the actual capture start lines that look like:
#
#   $bindir/capture -T 15 -r -s [baudrate] [device] [ttyport] >/dev/null 2>&1 &
#
# The -T option gives the idle timestamp interval; i.e., if output on the
# device occurs, and it has been more than <interval> seconds since the last
# output, a timestamp is output to the log before the current output.
# This helps identify long gaps between output in the logfile and effectively
# time stamps "blocks" of output in the log.
#
# You should put a "sleep 1" in after every 1-20 lines to avoid overload
# (since these are all background startups).
#
# XXX run_capture should be auto-generated.
