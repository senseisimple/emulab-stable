Wanetmon Architecture for PeLab

updated  Aug 28, 2006


(General Notes)

The terms "measurement" and "test" are used interchangeably throughout
the documentation and code of this project. Both refer to a logical
entity that runs a utility to determine a specific property of a
network path, such as latency or bandwidth.


(File Descriptions)

+ bgmon.pl - Background Monitor - runs on each node participating in
gathering measurements.  Each receives "control" commands from a
central source (ops, in this case) to change: the destination nodes,
the tests that are run (latency and/or bandwidth) to each dest node,
and the period between tests. Tests are run by forking off other apps
(ping and iperf) and parsing the result. A "result" notification is
sent back to ops upon test completion.

+ manager.pl - a utility to be run on ops to send control commands to
a set of nodes. This is most useful to manually adjust measurement
frequency of specific nodes of interest. Read comments at top of file
for more details.

+ automanage.pl - a utility to automatically maintain measurements
between given nodes/sites. It selects a node from each site based on
availability and calculates the measurement period based on the number
of testable nodes.

+ opsrecv.pl - runs on ops and receives "result" messages sent
by those nodes running bgmon.pl . Saves these results to the ops MySql
DB.

+ runbgmon - startup script to get bgmon.pl going on the nodes at
bootup.

+ packbgmon - stupid script to give me a bgmon tar that my experiments
load onto nodes.

+ testsend.pl - Run on ops. Sends a command to a single node. Command
line parameters not used can be set to anything for placeholders.

+ libwanetmon.pm - Common subroutines and variables used in many
scripts in this system.

+ pelab.sh - Daemon startup script that goes in /usr/local/etc/rc.d on
our ops node.

(Overview - bgmon.pl) 

The API for bgmon is as follows. Commands are given to the bgmon
through a TCP connection as a serialized hash (see code for
details). Possible commands are "EDIT", "INIT", "SINGLE", "STOPALL",
and "DIE". EDIT starts/modifies a single measurement type to a
specific destination by specifying destination, test type, and test
period. INIT starts/modifies tests to a set of destination nodes of a
particular test type with a testing frequency. SINGLE performs a
single test to a given node of a given test type without
recurrance. STOPALL removes all test scheduling information. DIE
forces a node's bgmon.pl to exit.

The result from each test is sent to "ops" in a UDP message. The
message contains the following fields: source node, destination node,
test type, result (the actual value), timestamp of source node when
test started, and a 'magic' ID (Leigh added this, but I think it
reduces the chance of a random UDP message being interpreted as a
wanetmon message). The receiving machine (ops, in this case) sends
back an acknowledgement to the source machine to provide
application-layer reliability.

The settings for each path-to-test is stored in a multi-level hash
structure called %testevents. The first key to access the hash is the
destination node (ex: plab20). The second is the type of test to this
node (ex: bw). The third references the desired value (ex: "testper",
"timeOfNextRun", "flag_scheduled").

Each instance of a test has a corresponding application that is
run. The applications are ping and a modified iperf. (iperf is
modified to exit with an error code) When a test is ready to be run,
bgmon forks one of these test apps with its output redirected to a
temporary file. When the test app exits, bgmon parses this file for a
result, and sends it to ops.

There are a variety of possible errors that the measurement apps can
have. These are detected by parsing the measurement output. If the
test was determined to have an error, the corresponding numeric error
value is looked up in the hash ERRID, in libwanetmon.pm . This error
value is stored in the test result field of the data structure sent to
ops. Ops adds this to the database like any other "valid" test
result. Later analysis of the data can look for these error values when
evaluating a path.

Program flow for bgmon revolves around a poll loop. Each iteration, it
blocks on a select call for a number of seconds (0.1, currently) to
check for ready sockets (to receive a command or ack). It then checks
each entry in %testevents and performs any number of the following to
that entry: handle a test app that has exited, send the result of a
completed test, run a test that is ready, and schedule a new test to
run in the future.

A test result is cached in a file before being sent to ops. It is
deleted when ops returns an ack message with the corresponding
index. There is a limit for how many ack-pending files can exist. When
the limit is reached, newly-completed tests are sent to ops, but not
cached until an ack for an existing file is received. Cached results
are resent to ops at a rate determined with the cacheSendRate variable.

The scheduling algorithm does not guarantee completion of measurements
with hard time bounds as a real-time system does. However, there are
mechanisms in place to attempt best effort service.  There can be only
one outstanding measurement to a single destination at a time. In
other words, another test to the same destination cannot start until
the previous one finishes.  Each poll loop, the current system time is
compared with timeOfNextRun for each schedulable test. If current time
is greater, the test is started. However, if the maximum number of
tests of that type is already being run, the pending test is put on a
wait queue. The events in the wait queue are run every X times through
the main poll loop.


(Overview - automanage.pl)

Automanage is one of many potential "manager" applications. A manager
application is one which gives commands to one or more bgmon
apps. Automanage attemps to choose a single node from each site to run
measurements to/from, and do this without an operator's assistance.

Data Structures:
  %allnodes: filled with the latest status of each node from an XML-RPC call.
%sitenodes: mapping from a given site (key) to a list of nodes (value).
  %intersitenodes: list of nodes chosen to form a fully connected test with each
site.
  @constrnodes: list of nodes from which automanage can choose to form
%intersitenodes. Sets a constraint on which nodes and sites are used.
  %deadnodes: records what nodes seem to be non-responsive.

Automanage periodically gets the status of planetlab nodes through the
XML-RPC interface. For each unique site, a "bestnode" is chosen based
on up/down status and load. The complexity of this application comes
when sites and nodes change. All nodes at a site can go down, the
bestnode at a site can change, or a new site can become
available. Automanage handles each of these cases.

The user API of automanage is entirely on the command line (for
now?). The key parameters are the latency measurement period (in
seconds), the bandwidth measurement duty-cycle (a fraction), and a
node-constraint file. The duty-cycle refers to the amount of time that
any one node is performing a bandwidth test. If a value of 0.1 was
given, 10% of the time a particular node will be running iperf. This
measurement frequency is specified in this manner to allow for
automatic adjustments based on the number of sites included in the
measuement set. The measurement set is constrained first by the nodes
listed in the constraint file, then by the sites which have available
nodes. An example bandwidth period calculation is as follows. Given:
150 sites, 0.1 duty-cycle, and 10 second iperf duration; each test
frequency from a given node shall be (150 - 1) * 10 sec * (1/0.1) =
14900 seconds = 4 hours. Bandwidth tests should not be run at 100%
duty cycle to avoid flooding the link.





*******************************************************************************



Wanetmon Features (TODO)

(1) High Freq. period for latency test
  - Q: keep same test results format (one msg per ping? that's wasteful...)

(2) Determining paths that are down and outage periods. This should be
    done on each node using latency results (for now). The node should
    take responsibility for upping the latency measurement rate to get
    a higher resolution of the outage period duration.

(3) Security 
  - Currently everything controlled with unencrypted and
    unauthenticated UDP and TCP.
 
(4) Duration of rate change specification (for temporary user-centric
measurements) 
  - A field to the EDIT command will give a duration in
    seconds for the change to last.

(5) Minimum Period saftey cap (prevents users from horrendously flooding a link)
  - Just check each EDIT command for validity.
  - Q: how to find this cap?
